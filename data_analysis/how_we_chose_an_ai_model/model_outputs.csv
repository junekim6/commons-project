ATF,ATF-2023-0002,ATF-2023-0002-369205,"Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers.   The ATF’s proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized.   1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale—or no sale at all—might require a license:  ATF’s rule claims that the agency has opted not to ""establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year"" that require licensure, and instead suggests that ""even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."" However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who ""regular[ly]"" and ""repetitive[ly]"" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple ""firearms.""   2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:  Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted ""occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby."" According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF’s rule provides no such assurances.  3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:  Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer—private gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court’s Caniglia decision in 2021.   In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called ""welfare check."" But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police—and the Biden administration—with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.  4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:  One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have ""willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license."" Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior.   Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF’s footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don’t!   5. ATF’s backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration:   So-called ""Universal Background Checks"" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime.   The Biden Administration described this as ""moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation."" And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales.   But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.

FMCSA,FMCSA-2023-0236,FMCSA-2023-0236-0030,"The Commercial Vehicle Training Association  (CVTA) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) on the exemption application submitted by the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV). Please see the Association's comment in the attached document.                January 3, 2024    Richard Clemente  Driver and Carrier Operations Division, Office of Carrier, Driver, and Vehicle Safety Standards  Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)  U.S. Department of Transportation  1200 New Jersey Ave, S.E.  West Building, Sixth Floor  Washington, D.C. 20590-0001    Re: Docket No. FMCSA-2023-0236: Commercial Driver’s License: Florida Department of Highway  Safety and Motor Vehicles; Application for Exemption    Mr. Clemente,     The Commercial Vehicle Training Association1 (CVTA) appreciates the opportunity to provide  comments to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) on the exemption  application submitted by the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles  (FLHSMV).    CVTA supports FLHSMV’s exemption request and encourages FMCSA to grant it.    Current federal regulations require that the Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) skills test be  administered and successfully completed in the following order: pre-trip inspection, basic  vehicle control skills, and on-road skills. The FLHSMV exemption would provide discretion to  Florida skills test examiners to allow a CDL applicant to continue with subsequent segments of  the CDL skills test if the applicant fails either the pre-trip inspection or the basic vehicle control  skills segments. Under the exemption, the applicant would be allowed to return later and retest  in only the failed segments.    This discretion would provide additional flexibility to Florida’s CDL testing program that would  help address skills testing delays.            1 Founded in 1996, the Commercial Vehicle Training Association (CVTA) is the largest association representing commercial truck  driver training programs in the United States. CVTA membership includes nearly 100 member schools with about 400 training  locations in 46 states. CVTA members collectively train 100,000 commercial drivers annually.     The FLHSMV exemption will increase the efficiency in the skills testing process.    Under current regulations, an applicant who fails one of the two initial segments of the skills  test has their test stopped, and they must return to retake the entire test later. Incorporating  the FLHSMV exemption will increase efficiency by allowing applicants to successfully complete  as many segments as they are able and then return for shorter periods to complete any failed  segments later. As to the efficiency effect on examiners: current skills test examiners who are  scheduled for an entire skills test encounter down time when those segments aren’t completed.  The proposed exemption would allow for more efficient use of examiner on duty time.     Examiners will have discretion to decide whether their applicant is prepared to take  subsequent segments of the skills test.     The state of Florida entrusts third-party examiners to administer CDL skills tests and subjects  approved examiners to extensive auditing procedures under federal and state law. In the  instance where an applicant is not prepared to continue with subsequent segments after failing  an initial segment, examiners have the discretion to stop their test and return to begin the  examination in accordance with the non-exemption format. Providing these examiners  discretion in an environment regulated by a robust auditing regime will ensure that examiners  are utilizing the exemption when appropriate.    Skills testing delays are economically costly.     Independent economic analysis2 commissioned by CVTA demonstrates that skills testing delays  are costly to both CDL applicants and the nation’s economy. In 2016, 669,688 initial CDL skills  tests and retests experienced delays, totaling over 6.4 million days of delays. These delays put  jobs on hold for 258,744 drivers and resulted in over $1 billion in lost wages for these drivers. As  a result, federal and state governments missed out on an estimated $234 million in forgone  income taxes and $108 million in forgone state and local sales taxes that could have been  generated in the absence of skills testing delays.     Moreover, CVTA anticipates that each skills test delay would be more costly today than it was  under the 2016 analysis. In the years following the independent study, wages for truck drivers  have increased. For example, a compensation study published by the American Trucking  Associations (ATA) shows that driver compensation at surveyed firms increased by 18% between  2019 and 2021.3       2 Nam D. Pham and Mary Donovan, “Economic Impact of Wait Times for Commercial Driver’s Licenses Skills Tests,”  NDP Analytics, January 2019, available at: https://cvta.org/wp-content/uploads/Economic-Impact-of-Wait-Times- for-Commercial-Drivers-January-2019-final-010718.pdf   3 American Trucking Associations, “2022 Driver Compensation Study: Advanced Executive Summary,” June 30,  2022, available at:  https://ata.msgfocus.com/files/amf_highroad_solution/project_2358/ATA_2022_Driver_Compensation_Study_- _Press_Executive_Summary.pdf     Skills testing delays cause applicant skills to degrade.     The longer an applicant must wait to take a CDL skills test, the further they are from the training  they received to prepare for the exam. Allowing an applicant to test as quickly as possible and  begin their job means they will continue repetition in the skills needed to be a safe commercial  motor vehicle operator and will retain more of what they learned in their training.     Further, many motor carriers offer training to new hires, often called “finishing training” that  builds on the training they received prior to employment. Reducing the time lost to skills testing  delays means this finishing training can be accessed more quickly and create a solid  foundational skillset for safe operation on our nation’s highways.

The draft guidance avoids wasting billions of tax dollars on subsidies for dirty hydrogen production projects that would spike climate and health-harming pollution. Hydrogen produced by fossil fuels is never a climate solution and tax credits should only go to hydrogen projects that are truly clean. Clean hydrogen production must meet three key requirements: Electrolysis must be powered by clean electricity that is 1) drawn from newly built carbon-free sources, 2) physically deliverable to the electrolysis facility, and 3) matched hourly with the electrolyzer’s power consumption. The Biden administration must account for the full harms of producing hydrogen from methane, but its current modeling assumptions undercount climate pollution from the methane gas industry. The administration must also reject schemes that would reward polluters for creating more methane or allow the fossil fuel industry to greenwash its methane with biogas credits. The Inflation Reduction Act represents the single biggest federal effort to combat the global climate crisis, but its success greatly depends on how this administration implements it. We urge your agency to finalize strong guidance that will drive taxpayer dollars towards projects that do not exacerbate climate pollution from power plants or spur more fossil gas drilling.Sincerely,Dipali NPrinceton Junction, NJ",The commenter expresses their support for the strong guidance that recognizes the real impacts of producing hydrogen and clarifies which hydrogen projects will be eligible for the 45V tax credit established by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Without this consideration, your Environmental Assessment does not assess the full breadth of options to address deer-human conflicts. I also urge you to then implement these non-lethal strategies and pursue them first before lethal action is taken.  While I understand the challenges posed by urban deer populations, I strongly believe that a more compassionate and effective approach is needed and can be equally as effective as killing deer.

Frightening devices, animal behavior modification, and live capture and translocation offer humane alternatives as well.  Immunocontraceptives like GonaCon have also been proven effective at controlling deer populations, and an alternative that prioritizes immunocontraceptives as a solution should be given serious consideration within your Environmental Assessment.

EBSA,EBSA-2023-0014,EBSA-2023-0014-5644,"I am an Ameriprise Ficial advisor, and I am writing to express my concern about the Department of Labor proposal to redefine an investment fiduciary under ERISA. This proposed regulation is unnecessary, does not increase consumer protection, and should be withdrawn.   The Department has offered no justification for the newly proposed regulation. As with previous proposals that would deter the use of brokerage accounts, the cost and burden of this proposal is significant and would be harmful to retirement investors.   Since 2020, the SEC has been administering Regulation Best Interest - a policy framework authorized by Congress and implemented after considerable study by the SEC. Regulation Best Interest established uniform rules governing advice to retail investors which applies to both IRAs and to other investments in a client’s portfolio. Under Regulation Best Interest, my investment recommendations are already held to a best interest standard of care as they should be. Regulation Best Interest has preserved access to ficial advice and investor choice that benefit millions of American families and retirees. The Department’s proposal would be harmful to this progress.  Ameriprise Ficial works with more than 2 million households across the country. Clients rely on me and my firm to provide guidance on their retirement investments, including IRA accounts. Most retirement investors want to work with a ficial professional who knows them and can provide personalized, comprehensive guidance.   By limiting access to these services, the DOL proposal would make it harder for individuals to understand their full ficial picture and take the appropriate steps to save for their future. Furthermore, the proposal would make it more costly for small business retirement providers to access education and advice – the ficial burden of which would also be passed onto individual retirement savers, once again undercutting their ability to secure their ficial future.  It is clear that the implementation of the DOL’s proposed rule would do far more harm than good for the investors it seeks to protect. I urge you to withdraw it.

IRS,IRS-2023-0066,IRS-2023-0066-13046,"Thank you for issuing this strong guidance that recognizes the real impacts of producing hydrogen and clarifies which hydrogen projects will be eligible for the 45V tax credit established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The draft guidance avoids wasting billions of tax dollars on subsidies for dirty hydrogen production projects that would spike climate and health-harming pollution.    Hydrogen produced by fossil fuels is never a climate solution and tax credits should only go to hydrogen projects that are truly clean. Clean hydrogen production must meet three key requirements: Electrolysis must be powered by clean electricity that is 1) drawn from newly built carbon-free sources, 2) physically deliverable to the electrolysis facility, and 3) matched hourly with the electrolyzer’s power consumption.   The Biden administration must account for the full harms of producing hydrogen from methane, but its current modeling assumptions undercount climate pollution from the methane gas industry.

FDA,FDA-2019-N-5959,FDA-2019-N-5959-45499,"Dear Food & Drug Administration,  I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don't believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA's stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.  Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.  I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information. Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.  The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means. This goes against common sense and can put Americans' lives at risk. People deserve full access to their prescription drug information at all times, no matter their age, income, or geographic location.  I urge you to revise your proposed rule for patient medication information in two ways:  1. Require a standardized printed format that has been scientifically researched and proven to improve patient understanding.  2. Require the drug manufacturer to supply the printed information and have it accompany the drug product and not printed in a retail pharmacy.

IRS,IRS-2023-0066,IRS-2023-0066-3810,"Thank you for issuing this strong guidance that recognizes the real impacts of producing hydrogen and clarifies which hydrogen projects will be eligible for the 45V tax credit established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The draft guidance avoids wasting billions of tax dollars on subsidies for dirty hydrogen production projects that would spike climate and health-harming pollution. Hydrogen produced by fossil fuels is never a climate solution and tax credits should only go to hydrogen projects that are truly clean. Clean hydrogen production must meet three key requirements: Electrolysis must be powered by clean electricity that is 1) drawn from newly built carbon-free sources, 2) physically deliverable to the electrolysis facility, and 3) matched hourly with the electrolyzer’s power consumption. The Biden administration must account for the full harms of producing hydrogen from methane, but its current modeling assumptions undercount climate pollution from the methane gas industry. The administration must also reject schemes that would reward polluters for creating more methane or allow the fossil fuel industry to greenwash its methane with biogas credits. The Inflation Reduction Act represents the single biggest federal effort to combat the global climate crisis, but its success greatly depends on how this administration implements it.

The amount of foul particulates that are  emitted is shocking. Iâ€™ve never understood why diesel engines and  commercial vehicles were exempt from pollution controls. Itâ€™s an outrage! I am glad that you have proposed strong emissions standards for light- and  medium-duty vehicle pollution that move us forward in addressing harmful air  pollutants and global warming emissions. These standards will be a good step in the right direction to limit dangerous  smog forming and particulate emissions that can increase the risk of asthma  attacks, strokes, and heart attacks, and lowering global warming emissions.  Transportation is the number one contributor to global warming emissions in  the United States, and curbing these emissions will be critical to addressing  the climate crisis. However, we can go farther. We need to see the strongest possible standards  finalized this year. The EPA's Alternative 1 is a good start, but we need the  agency to set more stringent standards after Model Year 2030 to accelerate  our transition to zero-emissions and continue to make gas cars cleaner. Please finalize a regulation at least as strong as Alternative 1 and continue  working to make cars cleaner. In order to limit dangerous NOx emissions and other air pollutants, and  reduce global warming emissions to address the climate crisis, the EPA needs  to pass the strongest possible cleaner cars standards. Thank you for your  consideration.

EBSA,EBSA-2023-0014,EBSA-2023-0014-9050,"I am an independent financial advisor who provides financial planning and other services to help Main Street Americans plan for a secure financial future. As a member of the Financial Services Institute, I am writing to express my concern with the Department of Labor's (DOL) recently proposed Retirement Security Rule. If adopted, the Proposed Rule will harm the very retirement savers it seeks to help by limiting their access to the affordable financial advice, products and services on which they rely to secure a dignified retirement. Having a relationship with a trusted financial advisor helps people save more for retirement. I provide my clients with comprehensive financial advice and as an independent financial advisor, I can recommend products that are in their best interest. Currently, my clients can choose how to pay for that financial advice. Far from being a “junk fee,” commissions are an important way that advisors are able to serve those who may not otherwise be able to afford to work with an advisor because they have less investable assets. If this rule is finalized, I will be unable to work with smaller accounts or help lower and middle-income savers plan for retirement. This will most impact those earning below $100,000 per year. The DOL proposed a similar rule in 2016 and as a result more than 10 million smaller retirement account owners could no longer afford to work with their financial advisor. Not only did a Federal Court invalidate the 2016 Rule, but the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and state regulators imposed their own best interest standards. In light of the SEC’s Regulation Best Interest, the fact that more than forty states have adopted the NAIC model regulation, and DOL’s PTE 2020-02, which requires compliance with already established conduct standards, the proposed Retirement Security Rule is unnecessary. I urge the DOL to withdraw this rulemaking to support Main Street investors, small business owners, and our community's access to crucial financial advice.","The commenter, an independent financial advisor who provides financial planning and other services to help Main Street Americans plan for a secure financial future, expresses concern with the Department of Labor's (DOL) recently proposed Retirement Security Rule, stating that if adopted, it will harm the very retirement savers it seeks to help by limiting their access to the affordable financial advice, products and services on which they rely to secure a dignified retirement.",True positive,"The commenter, an independent financial advisor, is concerned that the Department of Labor's proposed Retirement Security Rule will limit access to affordable financial advice for retirement savers, especially those earning below $100,000 per year.

EBSA,EBSA-2023-0014,EBSA-2023-0014-6829,"I am an independent ficial advisor who provides ficial planning and other services to help Main Street Americans plan for a secure ficial future. As a member of the Ficial Services Institute, I am writing to express my concern with the Department of Labor's (DOL) recently proposed Retirement Security Rule. If adopted, the Proposed Rule will harm the very retirement savers it seeks to help by limiting their access to the affordable ficial advice, products and services on which they rely to secure a dignified retirement.    Having a relationship with a trusted ficial advisor helps people save more for retirement. I provide my clients with comprehensive ficial advice and as an independent ficial advisor, I can recommend products that are in their best interest. Currently, my clients can choose how to pay for that ficial advice. Far from being a “junk fee,” commissions are an important way that advisors are able to serve those who may not otherwise be able to afford to work with an advisor because they have less investable assets. If this rule is finalized, I will be unable to work with smaller accounts or help lower and middle-income savers plan for retirement. This will most impact those earning below $100,000 per year.    The DOL proposed a similar rule in 2016 and as a result more than 10 million smaller retirement account owners could no longer afford to work with their ficial advisor. Not only did a Federal Court invalidate the 2016 Rule, but the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and state regulators imposed their own best interest standards. In light of the SEC’s Regulation Best Interest, the fact that more than forty states have adopted the NAIC model regulation, and DOL’s PTE 2020-02, which requires compliance with already established conduct standards, the proposed Retirement Security Rule is unnecessary.    I urge the DOL to withdraw this rulemaking to support Main Street investors, small business owners, and our community's access to crucial ficial advice.

EBSA,EBSA-2023-0014,EBSA-2023-0014-0214,"Attached is a comment letter from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to the Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration regarding RIN 1210-AC02—Definition of Fiduciary.      December 21, 2023  Office of Regulations and Interpretations  Employee Benefits Security Administration  U.S. Department of Labor  200 Constitution Ave. NW  Washington, DC 20210    Re: RIN 1210–AC02—Definition of Fiduciary      On  behalf  of  the  National  Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners  (NAIC)1,  we  appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the Department of Labor’s (DOL)  proposed ""Retirement Security Rule: Definition of an Investment Advice Fiduciary"" and  proposed amendments to the prohibited transaction exemptions (PTEs) (collectively,  the “Proposed Rule”).    While  the  NAIC  typically  refrains  from  commenting  on  the  rule  proposals  of  fellow  regulators unless they are directly preemptive of our authorities, in this instance, we  are compelled to respond given the potentially significant impact the Proposed Rule  would  have  on  insurance  consumers  and  access  to  lifetime  income  products  in  retirement.  We  also  feel  compelled  to  respond  to  commentary,  used  by  the  Administration  to  justify  the  proposal,  that  disparages  the  ongoing  work  of  state  insurance departments to adopt and enforce comprehensive and consistent standards  of care for annuity products.     We are  disappointed  that  the DOL did not  engage or coordinate substantively with  NAIC  members—the  chief  insurance  regulators  from  the  50  states,  the  District  of  Columbia,  and  the  U.S.  territories—before  promulgating  the  current  Proposed  Rule.  While the DOL has interacted with NAIC staff and members, those discussions were    1 As part of our state-based system of insurance regulation in the United States, the National  Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) provides expertise, data, and analysis for insurance  commissioners to effectively regulate the industry and protect consumers. The U.S. standard-setting  organization is governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 states, the District of Columbia  and five U.S. territories. Through the NAIC, state insurance regulators establish standards and best  practices, conduct peer reviews, and coordinate regulatory oversight. NAIC staff supports these efforts  and represents the collective views of state regulators domestically and internationally. For more  information, visit www.naic.org.             focused almost exclusively on aspects of the NAIC model and provided no opportunity  for  discussion  of  DOL’s  own  work  or  thinking.  We  acknowledge  the  administrative  limitations  on  DOL’s  ability  to  share  or  discuss  the  text  of  proposed  rules,  but  substantive policy questions can and should be discussed with fellow regulators, even  if in the abstract, to avoid duplication or conflict. DOL should demonstrate interest in  coordination and harmonizing our respective rules given their overlapping impact on  the same population of companies, industry participants, and customers. Only after the  Proposed  Rule  text  was  released  did  DOL  engage  directly  with  insurance  commissioners, albeit with a limited 30-day exposure period underway to digest and  assess the proposal.     in,  and  fundamentally  disagree  with,  the  We  are  also  greatly  disappointed  Administration’s characterization of state consumer protections around annuity sales  as “inadequate” and providing “misaligned incentives.”2 The rationale and justification  for DOL’s work should stand on its own as complementary to robust state efforts and  should  not  mischaracterize  differences  in  regulatory  philosophy  as  an  absence  of  regulatory competence or efficacy in this space.       In  the  seven  years  since  the  DOL  last  put  forward  a  similar  fiduciary  proposal,  the  regulatory landscape for annuities has changed dramatically due, in large part, to the  diligent work of state regulators and their legislative counterparts. While the DOL has  shared  jurisdiction  with  the  states  with  respect  to  insurance  products  sold  through  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act  of  1974  (ERISA)  plans,  such  as  annuities,  states’  regulatory  responsibilities  extend  to  the  entire  market  for  such  products,  including disclosure requirements, professional standards of conduct for agents, and  supervisory controls. In short, state insurance  regulations cover all annuity products,  not just those purchased within ERISA plans.     State Consumer Protections are Comprehensive and Consistent  Following  extensive  deliberations  and  input  from  state  regulators,  consumer  representatives, and the insurance industry, the NAIC made significant revisions to its  Suitability  in  Annuity  Transactions  Model  Regulation  (#275),  adopting  a  best  interest  standard.  The  standard  requires  producers  and  insurers,  when  making  annuity  recommendations,  to  act  in  the  best  interest  of  the  consumer,  without  placing  their      2 https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/31/fact-sheet-president-biden-to- announce-new-actions-to-protect-retirement-security-by-cracking-down-on-junk-fees-in-retirement-investment- advice/   2             ficial interest ahead of the consumer's interest. These amendments were designed  to be consistent with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Regulation  Best Interest to ensure a high degree of harmonization among regulatory platforms.    To meet the new standard, states require that insurance agents and carriers act with  in  recommending  an  annuity.  The  “reasonable  diligence,  care,  and  skill”  recommended  specific  consumer’s “ficial  situation,  insurance  needs  and  ficial  objectives.”  Model  revisions  also  included  enhancements  to  supervision  to  assist  with  compliance,  and  development  of  additional  guidance  to  respond  to  common  state  implementation  questions to promote consistency not just in text but in practice. To date, 41 states have  implemented—and  five  states  are  actively  pursuing  adoption  of—the  NAIC’s  best  interest enhancements.   also  annuity  must  appropriately  address  the    Currently, the NAIC is working with states to coordinate a two-phase implementation  review  of  the  top  25  annuity  writers  in  the  United  States.  The  purpose  of  these  implementation  examinations  is  to  ensure  that  companies  are  appropriately  incorporating and executing the enhanced standards in their policies and procedures.    Retirement Savings Gap    Amid  these  ongoing  state  regulatory  efforts  to  enhance  consumer  protections,  the  elderly population in the U.S. has continued to grow at an unprecedented rate, while  the  working-age  population  has  contracted,  placing  an  increased  strain  on  public  assistance programs like Social Security and exacerbating the retirement savings gap.  Further,  defined-benefit  pension  plans  have  been  largely  replaced  by  defined- contribution plans in the workplace, which offer less certainty to retirement savers. And  nearly  half  of  all  workers  do  not  have  access  to  an  employer-sponsored  retirement  plan.  Given  these  challenges,  DOL  should  be  encouraging,  not  potentially  limiting,  access  to  well-regulated  retirement  guidance  and  products  such  as  annuities  that  could  help  to  bridge  the  retirement  savings  gap.  There  are  few  retirement  security  products  that  protect  consumers  from  their  own  longevity  risk  and  provide  lifetime  income, except annuities. Regulators, state or federal, should not substitute our own  judgement for those we intend to protect by potentially denying them access to such  products when they are appropriate to the retiree.

ATF,ATF-2023-0002,ATF-2023-0002-321550,"Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers.   The ATF’s proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized.   1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale—or no sale at all—might require a license:  ATF’s rule claims that the agency has opted not to ""establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year"" that require licensure, and instead suggests that ""even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."" However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who ""regular[ly]"" and ""repetitive[ly]"" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple ""firearms.""   2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:  Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted ""occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby."" According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF’s rule provides no such assurances.  3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:  Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer—private gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court’s Caniglia decision in 2021.   In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called ""welfare check."" But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police—and the Biden administration—with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.  4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:  One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have ""willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license."" Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior.   Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF’s footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don’t!   5. ATF’s backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration:   So-called ""Universal Background Checks"" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime.   The Biden Administration described this as ""moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation."" And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales.   But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment. ","The commenter expresses concerns about the ATF's proposed rule ATF 2022R-17, stating that it is an unconstitutional and erroneous interpretation of federal law that would lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations.

ATF,ATF-2023-0002,ATF-2023-0002-322681,"Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers.   The ATF’s proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized.   1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale—or no sale at all—might require a license:  ATF’s rule claims that the agency has opted not to ""establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year"" that require licensure, and instead suggests that ""even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."" However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who ""regular[ly]"" and ""repetitive[ly]"" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple ""firearms.""   2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:  Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted ""occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby."" According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF’s rule provides no such assurances.  3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:  Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer—private gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court’s Caniglia decision in 2021.   In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called ""welfare check."" But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police—and the Biden administration—with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.  4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:  One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have ""willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license."" Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior.   Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF’s footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don’t!   5. ATF’s backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration:   So-called ""Universal Background Checks"" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime.   The Biden Administration described this as ""moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation."" And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales.   But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.

ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale—or no sale at all—might require a license: ATF’s rule claims that the agency has opted not to ""establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year"" that require licensure, and instead suggests that ""even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."" However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who ""regular[ly]"" and ""repetitive[ly]"" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple ""firearms.""

In contrast, ATF’s rule provides no such assurances. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations: Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer—private gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court’s Caniglia decision in 2021. In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called ""welfare check."" But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police—and the Biden administration—with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed: One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have ""willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license."" Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior. Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms.

ATF,ATF-2023-0002,ATF-2023-0002-297512,"Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers.   The ATF's proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized.   1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale-or no sale at all-might require a license:  ATF's rule claims that the agency has opted not to ""establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year"" that require licensure, and instead suggests that ""even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."" However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who ""regular[ly]"" and ""repetitive[ly]"" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple ""firearms.""   2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:  Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted ""occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby."" According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF's rule provides no such assurances.  3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:  Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer-privat gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court's Caniglia decision in 2021.   In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called ""welfare check."" But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police-and the Biden administration-with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.  4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:  One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have ""willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license."" Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior.   Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF's footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don't!   5. ATF's backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration:   So-called ""Universal Background Checks"" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime.   The Biden Administration described this as ""moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation."" And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales.   But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.

I appreciate the steps Congress took in recent years with the SECURE Act and the SECURE 2.0 Act to help retirement savers. I don’t understand why the Labor Department is now threatening to reverse that progress and take away my options with overregulation on annuities, which are the only financial protection products that act like a traditional pension.Today’s economy creates anxiety for Americans’ retirement tomorrow, especially for middle-income savers. Let’s face it, while Social Security is a valuable safety net, I worry if I will be able to rely on it. This is unsettling for people approaching age 65 who are self-funding retirement through 401(k)s and IRAs.The Department of Labor is proposing a nationwide fiduciary-only regulation that would shut down access to financial protection options like annuities. Most middle-income people like me do not have the money to invest that fiduciaries require. This would make accessing annuities through a fiduciary-only unaffordable and unrealistic.As your constituent, I ask that you please take action and speak up to the Administration on this issue. Keep the annuity option open to ALL retirement savers. Don’t let Washington take away my choice to work with my local financial professional on the right retirement options for me.Regulations.Gov:Please withdraw this fiduciary-only regulation. It takes away the choice for people like me to get the type of financial guidance they want. I don’t have the resources, or the savings needed to work with a fiduciary investment adviser, nor do I want or need ongoing retirement account management fees. When it comes to retirement planning, I want and deserve options to make my hard-earned savings last.People like me are concerned about the future of retirement. While Social Security provides a safety net, I worry that it is at risk. Most workers, including the large portion of Americans turning 65, do not have traditional pensions. Instead, the majority relies on 401(k)s, IRAs and personal investments. Guaranteed lifetime income products like annuities are valuable for people who are self-funding their retirement.A federal fiduciary-only regulation would shut down access to options like annuities. It does not protect middle-income savers. Instead, it takes away my choice to work with a local financial professional on options that work for me. Please keep overregulation out of my retirement planning.Washington needs to consider the consequences. Don’t create a retirement lockout. Don’t make retirement cost more.

ATF,ATF-2023-0002,ATF-2023-0002-296798,"Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers.   The ATF's proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized.   1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale-or no sale at all-might require a license:  ATF's rule claims that the agency has opted not to ""establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year"" that require licensure, and instead suggests that ""even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."" However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who ""regular[ly]"" and ""repetitive[ly]"" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple ""firearms.""   2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:  Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted ""occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby."" According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF's rule provides no such assurances.  3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:  Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer-privat gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court's Caniglia decision in 2021.   In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called ""welfare check."" But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police-and the Biden administration-with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.  4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:  One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have ""willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license."" Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior.   Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF's footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don't!   5. ATF's backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration:   So-called ""Universal Background Checks"" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime.   The Biden Administration described this as ""moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation."" And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales.   But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.

ATF,ATF-2023-0002,ATF-2023-0002-350806,"Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers.   The ATF’s proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized.   1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale—or no sale at all—might require a license:  ATF’s rule claims that the agency has opted not to ""establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year"" that require licensure, and instead suggests that ""even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."" However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who ""regular[ly]"" and ""repetitive[ly]"" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple ""firearms.""   2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:  Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted ""occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby."" According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF’s rule provides no such assurances.  3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:  Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer—private gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court’s Caniglia decision in 2021.   In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called ""welfare check."" But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police—and the Biden administration—with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.  4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:  One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have ""willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license."" Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior.   Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF’s footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don’t!   5. ATF’s backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration:   So-called ""Universal Background Checks"" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime.   The Biden Administration described this as ""moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation."" And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales.   But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.

ATF,ATF-2023-0002,ATF-2023-0002-301263,"Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers.   The ATF's proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized.   1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale-or no sale at all-might require a license:  ATF's rule claims that the agency has opted not to ""establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year"" that require licensure, and instead suggests that ""even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."" However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who ""regular[ly]"" and ""repetitive[ly]"" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple ""firearms.""   2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:  Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted ""occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby."" According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF's rule provides no such assurances.  3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:  Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer-privat gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court's Caniglia decision in 2021.   In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called ""welfare check."" But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police-and the Biden administration-with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.  4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:  One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have ""willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license."" Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior.   Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF's footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don't!   5. ATF's backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration:   So-called ""Universal Background Checks"" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime.   The Biden Administration described this as ""moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation."" And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales.   But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.

ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale-or no sale at all-might require a license: ATF\'s rule claims that the agency has opted not to ""establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year"" that require licensure, and instead suggests that ""even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."" However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who ""regular[ly]"" and ""repetitive[ly]"" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple ""firearms."" ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress: Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted ""occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby."" According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF\'s rule provides no such assurances. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations: Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer-privat gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court\'s Caniglia decision in 2021. In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called ""welfare check."" But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police-and the Biden administration-with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed: One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have ""willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license."" Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior. Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF\'s footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don\'t! ATF\'s backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration: So-called ""Universal Background Checks"" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime. The Biden Administration described this as ""moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation."" And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales. But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.'}","{'ai_summary': ""The commenter argues that ATF's proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional interpretation of federal law, as it could classify individuals selling a single firearm as gun dealers, leading to warrantless searches and violations of the Second and Fourth Amendments.

ATF,ATF-2023-0002,ATF-2023-0002-330045,"Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers.   The ATF’s proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized.   1.

IRS,IRS-2023-0066,IRS-2023-0066-22830,"As the U.S. Dept. of Treasury seeks to finalize regulations for hydrogen (§45V), specific provisions – particularly those involving low carbon natural gas – are critical to the viability of the emerging hydrogen economy and to our nation’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas CO2 emissions.  However, the current proposal would not allow hydrogen producers to factor in the lower carbon intensity of their natural gas used in the production of clean hydrogen. Instead, it treats all natural gas the same and does not recognize investments made to lower CO2 emissions along the natural gas supply chain. As a result, the draft rule disincentivizes investments to lower CO2 emissions and undermines the goals of the Inflation Reduction Act.  Allowing hydrogen producers to input their actual carbon intensity based on CO2 emissions reported to the EPA of their individual operations could incentivize greater CO2 emissions reductions, create competition for the lowest-emitters and promote further innovation.  The United States has a strong strategic advantage in its quest to become a world leader in hydrogen with its natural gas resources. If implemented properly, incentives under §45V could help secure the future of major hydrogen projects across the country, support more jobs, expand manufacturing and facilitate national climate goals.

FTC,FTC-2024-0018,FTC-2024-0018-0861,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this. Apologies if not, but my brain is not doing too great right now as a result of being without my prescribed medication for just about 2 weeks now as a result of these shortages.  My doctor put in my prescription for dexmethylphenidate, a medication I have been taking for years without issue, on the 8th of February. It is now the 20th and it is still not in stock and the pharmacy does not have any information on when it may come in. I then called 4 locations in town to ask if they had it, none of them did. Neither did Walgreens, nor the 3 Walmart pharmacy locations I called after. I'm not asking for the name brand or anything either.   I need this medication to function. I work a high pressure and high stakes job and with sensitive legal information and this is destroying my ability to work effectively. I cannot focus, my emotional regulation is worse, it's a struggle to force myself out of bed, and I'm noticing an increase in impulse spending and binge eating. I am so close to quitting this job and I'm trying to hold it together, knowing that this decision is not logical, but it sure is tempting. I'm not like this when properly medicated, and would love to not look like a mess to my coworkers and boss and customers whenever I am forced to quit my medication randomly just about every other month due to supply shortages. I'm sure I'm not alone in this.  Every other month my prescription is delayed or I have to call multiple pharmacies to see if one has enough in stock. This is harder to do when you cannot place in this prescription in advance, meaning I have to be low and almost completely out before I can order more, giving me no buffer to have this sorted before the medication wears off and I now have to navigate this on top of the resurgence of my now unregulated ADHD symptoms.  The fact that I cannot have more than a 30 days supply despite being consistently and legally on this medication for several years, and having to contact my doctor every single time to have it refilled only to find out that I'm going to be out again for who knows how long only makes navigating an incurable condition that I was born with even more frustrating.

USBC,USBC-2023-0009,USBC-2023-0009-7375,"Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment on the proposed changes to the American Community Survey (ACS), specifically the questions regarding disability.  I write today to request that the proposed revisions to the disability questions be withdrawn until meaningful engagement has occurred with the disability community over these changes and then a new proposal is released for public comment.  The ACS questions on disability are one of the very few federal datapoints on disability and are critical for the disability community in local, state, and federal policymaking.  As such, it is critical that the ACS survey ask the proper questions to gather this critical data most effectively.  Unfortunately, people with disabilities have a long and tragic history of others making decisions for, or that directly impact, them without considering their thoughts, desires, wishes, life, and most importantly their actual experiences.  This is why “Nothing About Us Without Us” is the slogan of the disability community to provide a reminder about the need for this critical and important engagement.  That is exactly what happened here, a failure to consult or engage with the disability community over these critical questions about disability in the ACS.  To my knowledge, the Census Bureau did no meaningful engagement with the disability community before releasing this proposal, and that is unacceptable.  I request:  1)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>That none of the proposed changes to the disability questions be adopted prior to engagement and consultation with a diverse set of disability stakeholders.  After this, reissue the revised proposal for public comment.  2)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>As part of that engagement, the Census Bureau should convene a group with disability experience to discuss how to best measure disability.  This group needs to be diverse and intersectional and include people with disabilities, the disability advocacy community, and researchers.  Without input from people with disabilities, you should never formulate questions to capture what a disability is.  3)<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Going forward, the Census Bureau needs to prioritize active and intentional engagement with a diverse and intersectional group of people with disabilities, disability researchers, and other stakeholders to ensure that this and other future data collection includes questions that will accurately capture disability status and the characteristics and functionality of people with non-apparent disabilities such as traumatic brain injuries, chronic illnesses, mental health disorders, and learning and cognitive differences.  In conclusion, the proposed changes to the disability questions in the ACS survey should not be adopted nor finalized until there is active engagement and consultation with the disability community as discussed above.

The American spirit built the auto industry and defined the 20th century; the open road became a symbol of freedom. Now, this regulation threatens to TAKE AWAY OUR FREEDOMS by taking away our cars.  These new vehicle regulations proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are clearly designed to limit the production and sale of gas cars. And it’s very clear that Joe Biden and the far Left would like to ban gas cars altogether.  We like gas cars and we like being able to buy gas cars. We do not need the ny state to regulate our choice of car.  Regulating gas cars out of existence is extremely unpopular—it’s why this policy would never make it through Congress. It is why Biden is instead pushing this policy via the federal bureaucracy.  This regulation will limit my options when I go to buy my next car.  I will be stuck with a car or truck that is more expensive, of lower quality, or otherwise unable to meet my needs.  The result will limit American freedoms to go where we want when we want.  We will be forced to replace our gas cars with electric cars—which are more expensive, have shorter ranges, and line the pockets of the Chinese Communist Government because of the lithium mining needed.    The fact that the Chinese massively benefit from this proposed regulation ALONE should disqualify this regulation from being passed, let alone considered!  And exactly WHERE will the American people get all the electricity needed to power these EVs???  Our power grid is already pushed to the limit and is inadequate to meet our needs.  During peak demand, we currently suffer blackouts and brownouts across the country from existing electric demands.  Has anyone considered the devasting effect of adding massive numbers of EVs to this mix?  EV-created blackouts will put Amercans at massive health risk.  Without power, people in hospitals, nursing homes and American families in general will suffer and possible die, especially during extreme weather months when power is needed for heating and cooling and to keep food preserved.  (Emergency power only lasts so long in, which would mean a death sentence for hospitals and nursing homes!)  This regulation is the big-government ny state at its worst and must be stopped.  The American people DON'T want it. It hurts Americans and helps our adversaries.  Let’s keep America free—let us buy the car or truck that we want.

ATF,ATF-2023-0002,ATF-2023-0002-335660,"Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers.   The ATF’s proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized.   1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale—or no sale at all—might require a license:  ATF’s rule claims that the agency has opted not to ""establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year"" that require licensure, and instead suggests that ""even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."" However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who ""regular[ly]"" and ""repetitive[ly]"" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple ""firearms.""   2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:  Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted ""occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby."" According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF’s rule provides no such assurances.  3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:  Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer—private gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court’s Caniglia decision in 2021.   In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called ""welfare check."" But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police—and the Biden administration—with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.  4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:  One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have ""willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license."" Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior.   Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF’s footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don’t!   5. ATF’s backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration:   So-called ""Universal Background Checks"" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime.   The Biden Administration described this as ""moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation."" And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales.   But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.

ATF,ATF-2023-0002,ATF-2023-0002-309683,"Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers.   The ATF's proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized.   1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale-or no sale at all-might require a license:  ATF's rule claims that the agency has opted not to ""establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year"" that require licensure, and instead suggests that ""even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."" However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who ""regular[ly]"" and ""repetitive[ly]"" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple ""firearms.""   2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:  Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted ""occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby."" According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF's rule provides no such assurances.  3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:  Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer-privat gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court's Caniglia decision in 2021.   In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called ""welfare check."" But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police-and the Biden administration-with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.  4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:  One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have ""willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license."" Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior.   Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF's footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don't!   5. ATF's backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration:   So-called ""Universal Background Checks"" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime.   The Biden Administration described this as ""moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation."" And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales.   But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment. ","The commenter expresses concerns about the ATF's proposed rule ATF 2022R-17, stating that it is an unconstitutional and erroneous interpretation of federal law that would lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations.

This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court\'s Caniglia decision in 2021. In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called ""welfare check.""

Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior. Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF\'s footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don\'t! ATF\'s backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration: So-called ""Universal Background Checks"" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime. The Biden Administration described this as ""moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation."" And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales. But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.'}","{'ai_summary': ""The commenter argues that the ATF's proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional interpretation of federal law, as it could classify individuals selling a few firearms as gun dealers, leading to warrantless searches and other constitutional violations.

FDA,FDA-2019-N-5959,FDA-2019-N-5959-49392,"To Whom It May Concern,   I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don’t believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA’s stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.   Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.  I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information.  Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.   The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means. This goes against common sense and can put Americans’ lives at risk. People deserve full access to their prescription drug information at all times, no matter their age, income, or geographic location.   I urge you to revise your proposed rule for patient medication information in two ways:  1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Require a standardized printed format that has been scientifically researched and proven to improve patient understanding. 2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Require the drug manufacturer to supply the printed information and have it accompany the drug product and not printed in a retail pharmacy.

I object to the idea that I am presumed guilty of “impaired” driving until cleared by a robot. And I do not want technology to slow or pull my car off the road while I’m driving.  Congress said the NHTSA must be assured the technology is reliable and accurate before it can be required. There is no such technology, and as a consumer I do not accept its implementation.   Not every problem requires government intervention, but every government intervention creates problems. This regulation will drive up costs and create a whole new set of risks.  The technology being discussed — infrared biometric scans and video monitoring — is not sophisticated enough to be reliably accurate. Implementing such a requirement will lead to false positives where many, including those in emergency situations, won’t be able to drive their car.   In addition, if a driver is deemed “distracted,” there is no technology in this world that can take control of a car and steer it safely to the side of the road with 100 percent success. That would not just be a danger to the driver, but also to the surrounding cars and pedestrians on the road.  Such a requirement would also create a massive cybersecurity risk. Over a million cars are stolen each year. I don’t want thieves to have my biometric recordings or video of my driving.

ACF,ACF-2023-0007,ACF-2023-0007-11468,"Dear Secretary Becerra,  I write to comment on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families, “Safe and Appropriate Foster Care Placement Requirements for Titles IV-E and IV-B” (RIN: 0970-AD03).  This rule would impose an ideological agenda on the foster care system, to the detriment of children and the exclusion of people of faith. In the name of affirming adult choices, the rule would significantly reduce resources for children by falsely labeling people and religious organizations “unsafe” and “inappropriate.”  The proposed rule would force states to screen foster parents and foster-care organizations, making sure that they will “affirm” LGBT identities of children in their care, in the name of ensuring “safe and appropriate” care. But affirming a child’s self-proclaimed sexual identity, without regard for his or her sex, is harmful, and requiring it will exclude good people and organizations from helping kids struggling with their gender or sexual identity in an already over-taxed system. The new criteria would disqualify most faith-based providers from serving these kids and would essentially label people of faith and religious organizations “unsafe”!  This rule is predicated upon at least two false premises. First, it uncritically accepts the assertion that we must “affirm” a child’s sexual identity or risk pushing them toward suicide. Increasingly, there is better evidence that shows “gender affirming care” is causing more mental health distress rather than resolving it.  In fact, high-quality studies show that completed suicides do not go down when people are “affirmed” in a transgender identity, and that the overwhelming majority of children who are not “affirmed” in a transgender identity desist by the time they go through puberty—up to 70 percent of girls, and up to 98 percent of boys. It is essential to note the other increased risk factors for suicide that have been cited in the transgender-identifying population, namely a significantly greater incidence of adverse childhood experiences. A recent study, for example, from the pro-LGBT Williams Institute showed 45 percent of transgender identifying people reported childhood sexual abuse, 44 percent of transgender-identifying people reported childhood physical abuse, and fully 75 percent of transgender-identifying people reported childhood emotional abuse.  For the trauma survivor, an ideology that suggests a child can be born in the wrong body, unfortunately, fits hand-in-glove with the mentality of a person who self-harms and wants to dissociate from any aspect of their being or body that highlights vulnerability. Yet, despite this knowledge, clinical settings and research studies promoting transgenderism have not properly accounted for this significant variable and how it relates to gender dysphoria. These three resources explore these problems in greater detail: “Suicide Risk and Gender Transition: The Facts” (https://www.frc.org/blog/2021/07/suicide-risk-and-gender-transition-facts), “Do Not Sterilize Children: Why Physiological Gender Transition Procedures for Minors Should Be Prohibited” (https://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF20J34.pdf), and “The Trans Youth Phenomenon: Critiques & Hard Questions” (https://www.frc.org/booklet/the-trans-youth-phenomenon-critiques-hard-questions).  Second, it labels any foster-care family or institutional provider ""unsafe” and “inappropriate.” This is dangerous ground both legally and practically. Legally, it infringes on the right of people of faith to continue to make an outsized contribution providing homes and services to children in the foster-care system. Practically, it threatens to dramatically restrict the number of homes and service providers available to help children in an already strained system.  Foster care agencies have already been affected by challenges to the religious freedom of providers or foster families. This rule will further discourage religious families and individuals from applying to be foster parents or seeking employment in the foster-care profession. Religious people who worry that their sincerely held religious beliefs are deemed to not be “safe and appropriate” by the federal government are likely to think twice before entering the child welfare system. We need more, not fewer, loving families to open their homes for children in the child welfare system, and more, not fewer, individuals to dedicate their lives to helping these children. HHS should not be applying pressure on state agencies to discourage faith-based providers and religious families.  Ultimately, this rule will only harm, not help, children in foster care. For these reasons, I oppose implementation of this rule.

NHTSA,NHTSA-2023-0022,NHTSA-2023-0022-57795,"I urge NHTSA to adopt the strongest possible CAFE standards for all vehicle classes to deliver the highest benefits for consumers, public health and the climate. I support proposed alternatives PC6LT8 for passenger cars and light trucks and HDPUV14 for heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans.   Strong fuel efficiency standards are key to driving down toxic vehicle pollution and achieving climate justice. Vehicle pollution is linked to numerous health problems, thousands of premature deaths, and to the unhealthy air pollution levels affecting more than 1 in 3 Americans. Heavy duty vehicles are particularly problematic. Their fumes create “diesel death zones,” areas with elevated levels of asthma rates and cancer risks.   These impacts disproportionately afflict communities of color, people experiencing poverty, and those who live, work, or attend school near highways and major truck routes. Strong fuel efficiency standards would deliver life-saving relief to frontline communities and massive emission reductions worth up to $59 billion in net societal benefits.  More fuel efficient vehicles save Americans money. Current CAFE standards save consumers, on average, $7,000 on lifetime fuel savings, with owners of bigger vehicles like SUVs seeing more than $11,500 savings. Used car drivers also benefit. With increasing fuel economy standards, each generation of vehicles is more efficient than the last. Given that 70% of car sales are used cars, and purchasers often spend a higher share of their total income on gasoline and transportation, having efficient options becomes even more important for low and moderate income drivers. With gas prices on the rise and inflation cutting into family budgets, every dollar saved makes a difference.   Consumers want fuel-efficient cars.

ATF,ATF-2023-0002,ATF-2023-0002-302456,"Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers.   The ATF's proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized.   1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale-or no sale at all-might require a license:  ATF's rule claims that the agency has opted not to ""establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year"" that require licensure, and instead suggests that ""even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license."" However, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who ""regular[ly]"" and ""repetitive[ly]"" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple ""firearms.""   2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:  Additionally, Congress also expressly exempted ""occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby."" According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF's rule provides no such assurances.  3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:  Moreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer-privat gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court's Caniglia decision in 2021.   In that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called ""welfare check."" But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police-and the Biden administration-with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.  4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:  One footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have ""willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license."" Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior.   Such an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF's footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don't!   5. ATF's backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration:   So-called ""Universal Background Checks"" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime.   The Biden Administration described this as ""moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation."" And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales.   But as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.

These devices are inherently cruel and pose a danger to people, companion animals, and nontarget species, including threatened and endangered species.  The use of body-gripping traps to carry out lethal management on NWRS lands presents a threat to wildlife, ecosystems, recreationalists, and their companion animals and thus undermines the purpose for which these protected lands were established: to serve as a refuge where native wildlife can thrive, and all Americans can enjoy our great outdoors.

ACF,ACF-2023-0007,ACF-2023-0007-4925,"Dear Secretary Becerra,  I write to comment on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families, “Safe and Appropriate Foster Care Placement Requirements for Titles IV-E and IV-B” (RIN: 0970-AD03).  This rule would impose an ideological agenda on the foster care system, to the detriment of children and the exclusion of people of faith. In the name of affirming adult choices, the rule would significantly reduce resources for children by falsely labeling people and religious organizations “unsafe” and “inappropriate.”  The proposed rule would force states to screen foster parents and foster-care organizations, making sure that they will “affirm” LGBT identities of children in their care, in the name of ensuring “safe and appropriate” care. But affirming a child’s self-proclaimed sexual identity, without regard for his or her sex, is harmful, and requiring it will exclude good people and organizations from helping kids struggling with their gender or sexual identity in an already over-taxed system. The new criteria would disqualify most faith-based providers from serving these kids and would essentially label people of faith and religious organizations “unsafe”!  This rule is predicated upon at least two false premises. First, it uncritically accepts the assertion that we must “affirm” a child’s sexual identity or risk pushing them toward suicide. Increasingly, there is better evidence that shows “gender affirming care” is causing more mental health distress rather than resolving it.  In fact, high-quality studies show that completed suicides do not go down when people are “affirmed” in a transgender identity, and that the overwhelming majority of children who are not “affirmed” in a transgender identity desist by the time they go through puberty—up to 70 percent of girls, and up to 98 percent of boys. It is essential to note the other increased risk factors for suicide that have been cited in the transgender-identifying population, namely a significantly greater incidence of adverse childhood experiences. A recent study, for example, from the pro-LGBT Williams Institute showed 45 percent of transgender identifying people reported childhood sexual abuse, 44 percent of transgender-identifying people reported childhood physical abuse, and fully 75 percent of transgender-identifying people reported childhood emotional abuse.  For the trauma survivor, an ideology that suggests a child can be born in the wrong body, unfortunately, fits hand-in-glove with the mentality of a person who self-harms and wants to dissociate from any aspect of their being or body that highlights vulnerability. Yet, despite this knowledge, clinical settings and research studies promoting transgenderism have not properly accounted for this significant variable and how it relates to gender dysphoria. These three resources explore these problems in greater detail: “Suicide Risk and Gender Transition: The Facts” (https://www.frc.org/blog/2021/07/suicide-risk-and-gender-transition-facts), “Do Not Sterilize Children: Why Physiological Gender Transition Procedures for Minors Should Be Prohibited” (https://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF20J34.pdf), and “The Trans Youth Phenomenon: Critiques & Hard Questions” (https://www.frc.org/booklet/the-trans-youth-phenomenon-critiques-hard-questions).  Second, it labels any foster-care family or institutional provider ""unsafe” and “inappropriate.” This is dangerous ground both legally and practically. Legally, it infringes on the right of people of faith to continue to make an outsized contribution providing homes and services to children in the foster-care system. Practically, it threatens to dramatically restrict the number of homes and service providers available to help children in an already strained system.  Foster care agencies have already been affected by challenges to the religious freedom of providers or foster families. This rule will further discourage religious families and individuals from applying to be foster parents or seeking employment in the foster-care profession. Religious people who worry that their sincerely held religious beliefs are deemed to not be “safe and appropriate” by the federal government are likely to think twice before entering the child welfare system. We need more, not fewer, loving families to open their homes for children in the child welfare system, and more, not fewer, individuals to dedicate their lives to helping these children. HHS should not be applying pressure on state agencies to discourage faith-based providers and religious families.  Ultimately, this rule will only harm, not help, children in foster care. For these reasons, I oppose implementation of this rule.

ATF,ATF-2023-0002,ATF-2023-0002-356581,"Gun Owners of America has informed me that ATF has weaponized the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act as a backdoor to enact Universal Background Checks and Firearm Registration by claiming that hundreds of thousands of gun owners who sell a few personal firearms suddenly now must become federally licensed as gun dealers. \n\nThe ATF’s proposed rule ATF 2022R-17 is an unconstitutional and blatantly erroneous interpretation of federal law and must not be finalized. \n\n1. ATF is wrong to suggest a single firearm sale—or no sale at all—might require a license:\n\nATF’s rule claims that the agency has opted not to \""establish[] a threshold number of firearm sales per year\"" that require licensure, and instead suggests that \""even a single firearm transaction, or offer to engage in a transaction, when combined with other evidence, may be sufficient to require a license.\""\nHowever, the statutes enacted by Congress clearly do not intend to regulate the conduct of an individual who merely sells a single firearm. Instead, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(11), (21), (22), and (23) clearly contemplate regulating someone who \""regular[ly]\"" and \""repetitive[ly]\"" either (a) manufactures and sells or (b) purchases and resells multiple \""firearms.\"" \n\n2. ATF fails to protect unlicensed conduct exempted by Congress:\n\nAdditionally, Congress also expressly exempted \""occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby.\"" According to Congress, ATF cannot presume anyone to be \""engaged in the business\"" of dealing in firearms simply because they sold a few guns on a few occasions. In contrast, ATF’s rule provides no such assurances.\n\n3. Wrongfully licensing constitutionally protected activity will lead to warrantless searches and additional constitutional violations:\n\nMoreover, by selling a single firearm—and thus purportedly coming under the jurisdiction of the ATF as a newly-minted gun dealer—private gun owners can now be subjected to warrantless searches of their homes and their firearm collections. This is a clear violation of both the Second and Fourth Amendments, and it runs totally contrary to the Supreme Court’s Caniglia decision in 2021. \n\nIn that case, the Biden administration fully supported the ability of law enforcement to conduct warrantless searches of firearms in the home as part of a so-called \""welfare check.\"" But the Supreme Court ruled against the Rhode Island police—and the Biden administration—with a 9-0 vote. Now, the Biden administration is trying to implement warrantless searches though the back door and without even having a vote in Congress.\n\n4. ATF suggests it might deny a license to applicants who the agency ordered to become licensed:\n\nOne footnote in this proposed rule suggests the ATF might prevent a person from obtaining a license to even engage in future firearm transactions because they were presumed to have \""willfully engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license.\"" Therefore, the agency might warn that individual of their purportedly unlawful behavior. \n\nSuch an individual, wishing to complete a future firearm transaction without ATF harassment, might submit an application to obtain a license to deal in firearms. But ATF’s footnote suggests the law-abiding individual might be denied the license simply because their previous conduct was presumptively unlawful. Thus, law-abiding citizens wishing to avoid any legal grey area created by this ATF rule are damned if they do get a license, and damned if they don’t! \n\n5. ATF’s backdoor Universal Background Check includes Universal Firearms Registration: \n\nSo-called \""Universal Background Checks\"" are only enforceable with a gun registry. This rule proposes that private citizens be regulated by the federal government as gun dealers, forcing them to run background checks on every firearm transaction in a backdoor attempt to require private citizens to create, maintain, and eventually turn over these registration papers. Failure to fill out registration paperwork and create a paper trail for even a single firearm transaction will be considered a federal crime. \n\nThe Biden Administration described this as \""moving the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation.\"" And the rule is only enforceable by cannibalizing the existing commercial federal firearms license and background check system into an unconstitutional, illegal gun registration scheme for all firearm sales. \n\nBut as ATF checks in on private transactions, those who privately transfer a firearm without a license and who do not maintain federal gun registration paperwork will be presumed by ATF to be in noncompliance with the law. As such, this rule exceeds statute and infringes on the constitutional right protected by the Second Amendment.

About Santos      Santos  is  a  global  energy  company  committed  to  increasingly  cleaner  energy  and  fuels  production,  with  operations  across  Australia,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Timor-Leste,  and  Alaska.  Santos is one of Australia’s biggest domestic gas suppliers and a leading LNG supplier in the  Asia  Pacific  region.   In  Alaska, Santos  is  one of the  largest  leaseholders  in  the  State,  holding  leases across the North Slope on State of Alaska, Alaska Native, and federally managed lands.      On the North Slope, Santos is the operator of the Pikka Project on State of Alaska and Alaska  Native Corporation lands.  Development of  Phase 1 of the Pikka Project is currently underway  with first oil projected for 2026, which will bring an anticipated contribution of 80,000 barrels of oil  per  day  of  throughput  to  the  Trans  Alaska  Pipeline  System  (“TAPS”).    The  Pikka  Project  will  contribute  significantly  to  the  State  of  Alaska’s  economy,  with  widespread  benefits  across  the  region and State.  The Pikka Project is the largest project on State lands in the last 20 years, and  is the first oil project sanctioned in Alaska, and one of the first in the world, to be developed on a  net-zero basis for Scope 1 and 2 equity emissions from first oil.     Of  particular  interest  to  the  proposed  rulemaking,  Santos  holds over  a million  acres  of  leases  within the NPRA.  Santos acreage within the NPRA includes the Horseshoe Unit, which consists  of  BLM  and  State  of  Alaska  leases,  a  portion  of  which  are  in  the  Colville  River  Special  Area  (“CRSA”).  Santos also holds leases adjacent to and south of the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area  Page 1 of 9        (“TLSA”).  Santos stands to be impacted by any BLM changes to its management of the NPRA,  particularly with respect to its leases in and adjacent to Special Areas, which is the focus of this  rulemaking. Santos is concerned that despite BLM’s statements in the rulemaking that existing  leases  will  not  be  affected,  development  of  and  access  to  existing  leases  may  be  restricted,  delayed, or denied as an outcome of the proposed rulemaking. As currently drafted, the proposed  rulemaking exceeds BLM’s authority and  conflicts with law and Congressional intent regarding  management of federal lands in Alaska, and more specifically, BLM’s management of the NPRA.   For these reasons, Santos provides the following comments organized as such: I. Management  of the NPRA, II. Procedural Errors with the Proposed Rulemaking, III. Impacts to Existing Leases,  and IV. Specific Comments on the Proposed Rulemaking.     I.  History and Management of the NPRA  The NPRA was established in 1923 by President Harding as an emergency oil supply for the U.S.  Navy.  Following the establishment of the NPRA, over 100 exploration wells were drilled by the  Navy  and  others,  including  wells  discovering  the  Barrow  gas  fields.    Then  in  1976,  Congress  transferred management of the NPRA from the Navy to the Department of Interior with the primary  purpose  of  establishing  and  managing  an  expeditious  oil  and  gas  leasing  program  and  development of the NPRA. In 1981, Congress passed the 1981 Department of Interior (“DOI”)  Appropriations  Act  directing  BLM  to  manage  an  expeditious  program  for  competitive  leasing,  prioritizing resource development as the primary purpose of BLM’s management of the NPRA.   The first lease sale was held the following year and BLM has historically administered oil and gas  leasing and development through Integrated Activity Plans (“IAPs”).  Development of IAPs is an  iterative  process,  with  extensive  public  engagement,  consultation,  and  best  available  science  backed by a comprehensive Environment Impacts Statement (“EIS”), identifying areas available  for leasing and Best Management Practices and/or Required Operating Procedures.    Notably,  the  NPRA  is  exempt  from  many  of  the  provisions  of  Federal  Land  Policy  and  Management Act (“FLPMA”), which the proposed rulemaking seems designed to emulate in word  and practice.  In fact, in many of the public meetings on this rulemaking, BLM represented that  the  proposed  rulemaking  would  bring  management  of  the  NPRA  more  closely  aligned  with  FLPMA. This approach defies the fundamental and distinct considerations that must guide BLM’s  management of the NPRA as opposed to other federal lands. Just last year, BLM affirmed  the  unique requirements that apply to its management of the NPRA: “[b]ecause of the exemption from  FLPMA Section 202 and that the NPRA is a domit-use statute, the IAP is not developed as  a resource management plan and does not consider sustained yield and multiple use” [Emphasis  Added]1. Further evidence of Congressional intent in regard to the management of the NPRA is  that  the  subject  lands  were  not  set  aside  in  Alaska  National  Interest  Lands  Conservation  Act  (“ANILCA”),  which  passed  in  1980,  only  one  year  prior  to  the  1981  Department  of  Interior  Appropriations Act. Had Congress desired for NPRA lands to be managed as wilderness, or solely  for the “maximum protection of surface resources” it could have included them in the 157 million  acres of lands set aside by Congress in ANILCA as national parks and preserves, national wildlife  refuges, designated wilderness areas, and wild and scenic rivers.      BLM should not disregard the lengthy legislative history of federal land management in Alaska  and its own obligations to manage the NPRA as directed. The primary purpose of the NPRA is  “to increase domestic oil supply as expeditiously as possible” and “advance private oil and gas  development on the NPR-A.”2 Despite the long history of leasing, exploration, and, more recently,      1 National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, Integrated Activity Plan Record of Decision. April 2022. DOI- BLM-AK-R000-2019-0001-EIS, Page 3.   2 ConocoPhillips Alaska, Inc. v. Alaska Oil & Gas Conservation Comm’n, No. 3:22-CV-00121- SLG, 2023 WL 2403720, at *8 (D. Alaska Mar. 8, 2023).  Page 2 of 9        development  in  the  NPRA,  administered  by  the  Navy  and  BLM,  the  proposed  rule  appears  designed to undermine that primary purpose of the NPRA and explicitly re-prioritize the legislated  purposes of the NPRA.  BLM does not have the authority to change the purpose, priority, and  mandates of Congress as proposed in this rulemaking.      Of particular note, BLM proposes changes to the “objectives” section of the current regulations  (See  43  §  2361.1).    In  doing  so,  BLM  disregards  BLM’s  primary  purpose  under  NPRPA:  expeditious leasing, exploration, and development of the NPRA. BLM is attempting to create a  new objective focused solely on protection of the surface.  The objectives of protecting surface  and developing NPRA resources are not mutually exclusive, as demonstrated by the legacy of  resource development across the North Slope done in an environmentally and culturally sensitive  manner. Regardless, BLM’s directive to manage the NPRA cannot be ignored by BLM.  While the  proposed  rulemaking  lauds  “maximum  protection”,  BLM  omits  the  remainder  of  the  NPRPA:  “…maximum protection of such surface values to the extent consistent with the requirements  of  this  Act  for  the  exploration  of  the  Reserve”  [Emphasis  Added].    In  several  places,  BLM  proposes deleting this clause and similar language in an apparent attempt to dilute or bury its  obligations under the NPRPA and associated law.  BLM should not delete this language, as it  creates confusion, uncertainty, and is inconsistent with the directive by Congress for management  of the NPRA.     II.  Procedural Errors with the Proposed Rulemaking  BLM’s  determination  that  the  proposed  rulemaking  is  not  significant  is  flawed.    The  proposed  rulemaking  meets  nearly  every  condition  to  be  considered  a  significant  regulatory  action  as  defined by Executive Order 12866, as amended by Executive Order 140943. Therefore, additional  environmental and economic analysis is required.     In response to BLM’s conclusion that the proposed rulemaking is not significant, Santos offers  the following:   •  BLM’s  proposed  language  presuming  that  no  additional  leasing,  development,  and/or  infrastructure within Special Areas will be allowed, paired with the proposed discretion of  the Authorized Officer to establish interim/emergency protections on lands considered for  Special Areas, is a significant regulatory action.  Of the four developments (proposed and  constructed) within the boundary of the NPRA, all four are within or near Special Areas.  The Willow Development Project is within the TLSA and GMT2 is within 0.1 miles of the  CRSA.        BLM’s  Economic Analysis  is  insufficient,  given  a  single  project  similar  to  the  existing developments would exceed the $200 million threshold to determine a significant  regulatory action described in EO 14094 Section 3(f)(1).  BLM’s Economic Analysis fails  to even acknowledge this fact.  •  Next, while BLM argues that there is little interest in leasing of the Special Areas, BLM’s  own Table 3 in the Economic Analysis summarizes that, since 2011, for five out of nine  years, there has been greater leasing in the Special Areas than the rest of the NPRA. BLM  then states: “There are existing leases in the CRSA and TLSA, and a future decision to      3 Executive Order 14094 defined a “significant regulatory action” to mean any regulatory action that is  likely to result in a rulemaking that may: (1) have an annual effect of the economy of $200 million or more;  or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,  jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, territorial, or tribal governments or  communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by  another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan  programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise legal or policy issues for which  centralized review would meaningfully further the President's priorities or the principles set forth in this  Executive order, as specifically authorized in a timely manner by the Administrator of OIRA in each case.

IRS,IRS-2023-0066,IRS-2023-0066-23141,"As the U.S. Dept. of Treasury seeks to finalize regulations for hydrogen (§45V), specific provisions – particularly those involving low carbon natural gas – are critical to the viability of the emerging hydrogen economy and to our nation’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas CO2 emissions.  However, the current proposal would not allow hydrogen producers to factor in the lower carbon intensity of their natural gas used in the production of clean hydrogen. Instead, it treats all natural gas the same and does not recognize investments made to lower CO2 emissions along the natural gas supply chain. As a result, the draft rule disincentivizes investments to lower CO2 emissions and undermines the goals of the Inflation Reduction Act.  Allowing hydrogen producers to input their actual carbon intensity based on CO2 emissions reported to the EPA of their individual operations could incentivize greater CO2 emissions reductions, create competition for the lowest-emitters and promote further innovation.  The United States has a strong strategic advantage in its quest to become a world leader in hydrogen with its natural gas resources. If implemented properly, incentives under §45V could help secure the future of major hydrogen projects across the country, support more jobs, expand manufacturing and facilitate national climate goals.

BLM,BLM-2023-0006,BLM-2023-0006-86368,"I am asking the Bureau of Land Management to withdraw this regulation. While I think conservation is an important goal, we must balance this aim with other concerns like national security.   It is important to note that the area in question has a history of over half a century of oil and natural gas production. During that time, producers have shown that they are active partners in conservation initiatives. A few examples include work done to research and manage human-polar bear interactions and deploying measures to protect caribou during calving season. Oil and natural gas operations on federal lands in Alaska are subject to stringent environmental reviews and have been conducted with an impressive track record of environmental protection. This experience with development on Alaska’s North Slope and associated offshore areas provides strong support for the continued competitive leasing of oil and natural gas in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   This regulation prioritizes conservation goals without considering its myriad negative impacts. By potentially limiting oil and natural gas exploration in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A), the United States may be forced to rely on foreign oil sources in the event of supply issues – thus weakening our energy and national security. Additionally, this policy could create widespread uncertainty for current projects in the NPR-A and other federal leasing areas, potentially weakening investment in Alaska. A strong energy reserve is critical to protecting our national interests and should be considered in this deliberation.

FWS,FWS-HQ-NWRS-2022-0106,FWS-HQ-NWRS-2022-0106-18170,"Please accept my comments on the Proposed Rule, ""National Wildlife Refuge System: Biological Integrity, Diversity, and Environmental Health.""  I fully support the protection of native carnivores on national refuge system lands. The FWS needs to strengthen the rule by explicitly prohibiting the killing of all native carnivores under the rule’s “predator control” provision. Currently the provision prohibits carnivore killing that would “alter predator-prey population dynamics,” leaving it unclear if individual animals could still be targeted, including at the behest of livestock interests. The rule should also remove loopholes (e.g. fulfilling refuge purposes and pursuing biological goals), particularly in Wilderness.

There is no such technology, and as a consumer I do not accept its implementation. Not every problem requires government intervention, but every government intervention creates problems. This regulation will drive up costs and create a whole new set of risks.The technology being discussed — infrared biometric scans and video monitoring — is not sophisticated enough to be reliably accurate. Implementing such a requirement will lead to false positives where many, including those in emergency situations, won’t be able to drive their car. In addition, if a driver is deemed “distracted,” there is no technology in this world that can take control of a car and steer it safely to the side of the road with 100 percent success. That would not just be a danger to the driver, but also to the surrounding cars and pedestrians on the road.Such a requirement would also create a massive cybersecurity risk. Over a million cars are stolen each year. I don’t want thieves to have my biometric recordings or video of my driving.

NHTSA,NHTSA-2022-0079,NHTSA-2022-0079-2326,"On January 17, 2015, Our lives were tragically turned upside down when a drunk driver hit me and two coworkers head-on while traveling home from work. I had just told my two friends/coworkers it was freezing, and we had to take it easy on this trip. When I looked up, I saw bright headlights coming straight at us. It is estimated the drunk driver was traveling over 100 miles an hour. The next thing I knew, I was in a place of quietness and peace when I heard the voice of God ask me do you want to come home or stay with Linda. I chose to stay with my wife. One of my coworkers got out of the van and called Linda, while the other was hurt and trapped. He was not seriously injured like I was. The next thing I heard was the sirens and my wife saying Jim, I'm here. She had to stand and watch as I was cut from our van. My injuries were life-threatening to the point EMS thought I was going to die at any moment, so they put me in the back of the ambulance and took me to a hospital approximately 4o minutes away. Everyone else involved in the accident was airlifted from the scene. When I arrived at this hospital, they airlifted me to a level-one trauma center, where I ended up spending a total of 8 months. At the time of this writing, I have endured over 50 surgeries, primarily orthopedic. I have had to spend time in 2 nursing homes and countless hours of rehab. My wife and I had to sell our house and buy a new one that we made handicapped accessible in town instead of in the country where we used to live on our farm. I now live in chronic pain and with a chronic infection, which has caused me to lose all of my toes. I also live with PTSD, and my wife is now my full-time unpaid caregiver, so we live on my disability income because my wife cannot leave my side as I now spend most of my time in an electric wheelchair. In our state, spouses are not paid to care for each other. A young man's decision has seriously impacted our lives because he chose to drink and drive.

FDA,FDA-2019-N-5959,FDA-2019-N-5959-8532,"Dear Food & Drug Administration,  I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don't believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA's stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.  Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.  I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information. Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.  The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means. This goes against common sense and can put Americans' lives at risk. People deserve full access to their prescription drug information at all times, no matter their age, income, or geographic location.  I urge you to revise your proposed rule for patient medication information in two ways:  1. Require a standardized printed format that has been scientifically researched and proven to improve patient understanding.  2. Require the drug manufacturer to supply the printed information and have it accompany the drug product and not printed in a retail pharmacy.  Doing so will help save lives and improve medication outcomes.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

FDA,FDA-2019-N-5959,FDA-2019-N-5959-42894,"Dear Food & Drug Administration,  I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don't believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA's stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.  Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.  I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information. Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.  The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means. This goes against common sense and can put Americans' lives at risk. People deserve full access to their prescription drug information at all times, no matter their age, income, or geographic location.  I urge you to revise your proposed rule for patient medication information in two ways:  1. Require a standardized printed format that has been scientifically researched and proven to improve patient understanding.  2. Require the drug manufacturer to supply the printed information and have it accompany the drug product and not printed in a retail pharmacy.

BLM,BLM-2023-0006,BLM-2023-0006-81728,"Dear Bureau of Land Management,  I am opposed to oil and gas development in the Western Arctic.  Such development would be incompatible with meeting urgently needed commitments to address the climate crisis.  To demonstrate climate leadership and meet our commitments, the nation needs to move rapidly away from burning fossil fuels. There is no room for expansion, particularly in the Arctic, where oil would not come to market for years. The huge infrastructure build-out required would lock us into reliance on fossil fuels, while bringing further stress to a region feeling climate effects even more acutely than lower latitudes.  I urge the administration to take measures to bring its management of the Western Arctic in line with its commitment to address the climate crisis.     The proposed regulations are a step in the right direction but do not go far enough.  They offer important incremental protections for some of the Western Arctic’s most ecologically and culturally important areas, such as Teshekpuk Lake, an internationally vital wetland critical for birds from around the globe and for caribou herds that are integral to Alaska Native communities in the region.  However, they do not do enough to address the most imminent threat to the region and the planet—the over two million acres of existing oil leases in the Western Arctic that this administration inherited.  Development on these existing leases—like Willow—threatens the sensitive habitat of the Western Arctic and the nation’s ability to meet its climate goals.     The current environmental analysis of the Western Arctic, written in the previous administration, fails to study the impact oil development in the region would have on the climate and the nation’s ability to rapidly reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to meet climate goals.  We urge the administration to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the climate impacts of Western Arctic oil development, and to bring its management of the region in line with climate policy by expanding its proposed regulations to require limits on drilling on the millions of acres already leased to oil companies to protect the climate and the fragile resources of the region already under severe strain from climate change.

As Indiana Wildlife Services states in the Environmental Assessment, educational outreach efforts already include promoting coexistence between humans and wild animals and human behavior modification. This should be emphasized and prioritized in the plan that Wildlife Services chooses to move forward with. The agency could also help to fund and develop new infrastructure to protect against bird damage.   In conclusion, the agency should either proceed with Alternative 2 or create an alternative that requires all non-lethal methods to be used to their fullest extent before lethal action is taken. Wildlife Services should also commit to exploring long-term, non-lethal solutions that promote harmony between humans and wild animals.

Person testifying: Brian Scarpelli  Title: Senior Global Policy Counsel    A summary of my testimony is as follows:    The  App  Association  represents  thousands  of  small  business  software  application  development  companies  and  technology  firms  that  create  the  software  apps  used  on  mobile devices and in enterprise systems around the globe. Today, the ecosystem the  App Association represents– which we call the app economy– is an economy worth more  than $1.7 trillion annually and that provides for over 5.9 million American jobs.  Alongside  the world’s rapid embrace of mobile technology (including mobile technology at issue),  our members have been creating innovative software and hardware technology solutions  that power the internet of things (IoT) across modalities and segments of the economy.     The infringement and theft of IP online threatens consumer welfare by undermining the   ability  of  creators  of  digital  content  to  innovate,  invest,  and  hire.  Each  kind  of  IPR  (copyrights,  trademarks,  patents,  and  trade  secrets)  represents  distinct  utilities  upon  which  App  Association  members  depend.  IPR  violations  lead  to  customer  data  loss,  interruption of service, revenue loss, and reputational damage – each alone is a potential  “end-of-life”  occurrence  for  a  small  app  development  company.  My  testimony  would  provide an overview of the App Association’s policy priorities related to the Special 301  investigation,  as  well  as  specific  issues  across  foreign  jurisdictions,  for  the  TPSC’s  consideration.

FDA,FDA-2019-N-5959,FDA-2019-N-5959-28551,"Dear Food & Drug Administration,  I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don't believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA's stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.  Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.  I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information. Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.  The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means. This goes against common sense and can put Americans' lives at risk. People deserve full access to their prescription drug information at all times, no matter their age, income, or geographic location.  I urge you to revise your proposed rule for patient medication information in two ways:  1. Require a standardized printed format that has been scientifically researched and proven to improve patient understanding.  2. Require the drug manufacturer to supply the printed information and have it accompany the drug product and not printed in a retail pharmacy.  Doing so will help save lives and improve medication outcomes.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

A recent study found that more than 1 in 5 gun sales in the U.S. are conducted without a background check, amounting to millions of off-the-books gun transfers annually; many of these transactions are facilitated by individuals who profit from the repetitive sale of firearms yet avoid the necessary oversight required of licensed dealers.

The issue of background checks on firearm sales is important to me.   For years, firearm sellers exploited a loophole in federal law to sell guns without conducting background checks. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act included a provision to tackle this loophole. The proposed rule makes clear: if you are selling guns to make a profit, then you are presumed to be in the business of dealing in firearms. For that reason, you need to be licensed and run background checks on customers.   Completed background checks save lives, but loopholes in current law put everyone at risk. This new rule can improve the use of the background checks system by expanding who is legally required to conduct a background check on a firearm buyer.   I believe the proposed rule is vital to keep our schools, homes, and communities safe. I strongly recommend ATF finalizes the proposed rule without delay.

OPM,OPM-2023-0001,OPM-2023-0001-2108,"I write today to express concern regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), issued by the Office of Personnel Management (“Suitability of Fitness Vetting”), published in the Federal Register on January 31, 2023 (the “proposed rule”).The proposed rule seeks to amend 5 CFR § 731.202(b)(7) which establishes a clear and easily applied standard against hiring applicants who knowingly and willfully engage in “acts or activities designed to overthrow the U.S. Government by force.” In particular, I worry that the proposed changes to existing regulation are so overly broad as to allow for, if not invite, viewpoint discrimination that would violate the First Amendment rights of patriotic Americans wishing to serve their country in the federal government. Further, I worry that elements of the new criteria could be used to discriminate against applicants based on their personal politics. Without a stricter delineation of allowable or disqualifying conduct, this new regulation will be used to further entrench bureaucratic power in the hands of unelected officials. It will slowly eliminate the introduction of new divergent viewpoints that are crucial to the maintenance of responsive and effective governance.The broad language in the proposed rule could easily be abused by hiring managers to disqualify otherwise qualified applicants for simply participating in legitimate political discourse or membership in organizations or movements that peacefully seek changes to our nation’s current laws and policies.The rule seems to forget that, going back to the founding, there have been legitimate and peaceful means for overthrowing our government periodically: elections. Furthermore, the FBI has classified parents as potential terrorists for protesting at school board meetings. Would all parents protesting on behalf of their children be deemed to have “sought to intimidate or coerce"" in a disqualifying manner? Would the very act of counseling a pregnant woman regarding her options and encouraging her to not pursue an abortion disqualify applicants to the civil service? Would membership at a conservative Christian church lead to a negative suitability determination?In the current political discourse, and as these ambiguous rules could be applied, the answer to these questions is undoubtedly “yes.”The proposed rule does not include any rule of application stating that the proposed factors should not be applied in a way that circumscribes a person’s constitutional liberties. If OPM is certain in its assertion that the proposed factors “address conduct that is not protected by the First Amendment,” then there is no principled reason not to include language stating that explicitly in the regulation. And yet, the proposed rule omits such explicit language, no doubt in the name of allowing for “nuance” in applying the new requirements.

BLM,BLM-2023-0006,BLM-2023-0006-81361,"Dear Bureau of Land Management,  I am opposed to oil and gas development in the Western Arctic.  Such development would be incompatible with meeting urgently needed commitments to address the climate crisis.  To demonstrate climate leadership and meet our commitments, the nation needs to move rapidly away from burning fossil fuels. There is no room for expansion, particularly in the Arctic, where oil would not come to market for years. The huge infrastructure build-out required would lock us into reliance on fossil fuels, while bringing further stress to a region feeling climate effects even more acutely than lower latitudes.  I urge the administration to take measures to bring its management of the Western Arctic in line with its commitment to address the climate crisis.     The proposed regulations are a step in the right direction but do not go far enough.  They offer important incremental protections for some of the Western Arctic’s most ecologically and culturally important areas, such as Teshekpuk Lake, an internationally vital wetland critical for birds from around the globe and for caribou herds that are integral to Alaska Native communities in the region.  However, they do not do enough to address the most imminent threat to the region and the planet—the over two million acres of existing oil leases in the Western Arctic that this administration inherited.  Development on these existing leases—like Willow—threatens the sensitive habitat of the Western Arctic and the nation’s ability to meet its climate goals.     The current environmental analysis of the Western Arctic, written in the previous administration, fails to study the impact oil development in the region would have on the climate and the nation’s ability to rapidly reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to meet climate goals.  We urge the administration to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the climate impacts of Western Arctic oil development, and to bring its management of the region in line with climate policy by expanding its proposed regulations to require limits on drilling on the millions of acres already leased to oil companies to protect the climate and the fragile resources of the region already under severe strain from climate change.

FDA,FDA-2019-N-5959,FDA-2019-N-5959-4887,"Dear Food & Drug Administration,  I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don't believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA's stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.  Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.  I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information. Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.  The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means. This goes against common sense and can put Americans' lives at risk. People deserve full access to their prescription drug information at all times, no matter their age, income, or geographic location.  I urge you to revise your proposed rule for patient medication information in two ways:  1. Require a standardized printed format that has been scientifically researched and proven to improve patient understanding.  2. Require the drug manufacturer to supply the printed information and have it accompany the drug product and not printed in a retail pharmacy.  Doing so will help save lives and improve medication outcomes.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

I am also one of In Defense of Animals’ over 250,000 supporters.   Shooting hundreds of thousands of one owl species to save members of another species is not a solution that addresses the root cause of northern owl population decline, and the ​​U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service should create a more comprehensive plan that addresses the threats of wildfires, the climate crisis, and habitat loss in particular related to the timber industry. The agency should also have more thoroughly considered non-lethal methods of removing barred owls in the detailed analysis.   Both wildfires and the timber industry are major drivers in habitat loss and ultimately the population decrease of northern spotted owls. In addition, the climate crisis is a key driver in barred owl encroachment on habitat range of Northern spotted owls, and was not addressed by the EIS.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service should also have more thoroughly considered non-lethal methods of removing barred owls such as translocation, hazing, and preventing reproduction. Moving forward, the agency should collaborate with other states and regions of less concern to the northern spotted owl to relocate barred owls. The agency should also implement a combination strategy incorporating nest destruction, egg removal, hazing nest sites, and sterilization, which could certainly be successful without interfering with spotted owl populations if administered with care.   In conclusion, by using all non lethal strategies in conjunction with habitat restoration, wildfire management, and climate change mitigation, northern spotted owls could be protected, and hundreds of thousands of barred owls could be spared.

HHS,HHS-OCR-2023-0013,HHS-OCR-2023-0013-3432,"Disability Accommodation Request Denials  My name is Jay Dahl. I have no pericardial sac around my heart to protect from viral attacks. I had a pericardiectomy six years ago. It has left me vulnerable to Flu, RSV and Covid. We have worn our masks indoors since the pandemic began, but got Covid in March of this year. I had two very severe and terrifying events with my heart as well as suffering arrhythmias and bouts of tachycardia. The first time, while on the phone with customers, I started to have an extreme pain in my head and suddenly couldn't see out of one eye. I had to leave my wife, who is also at high risk for complications should she get covid, at home because the emergency room is so dangerous. People are there because they are very sick and they aren’t masking, so often people are coughing, sneezing, have fever and are actively ill. This is where I needed to wait, with only my own mask for protection from all the respirations that had transpired throughout the day. She was terrified and didn’t want me to go alone, my symptoms sounded like a stroke. But what choice did we have? The second time I was having severe chest pains and knew I needed to go in to have it checked out. Again, forced into an unmasked environment with no time to ask for accommodations or make the space or people safer.  After those scares, we scheduled an appointment with a cardiologist who’s practice wears masks, or so we were promised. The cardiologist had his mask around his chin when we first met him. Later, when I went to have my treadmill test in the office, the technician refused to mask. I told her of my very serious heart condition, my vulnerability to viral attack and reminded her that this was a cardiology clinic with all high risk patients for severe complications from Covid the CDC recommends we avoid being unmasked indoors with people who live outside of our home. I reminded her that per her ethics standards she was to put the interest of her patient’s above her own. She disagreed. I called the manager & explained the ADA to her. She said she had never heard of the ADA besides as it applied to her workers. I reminded her that ignorance of the law is not a justification for violating it. I asked to speak to the owner, who was our  doctor. Dr. Sheriff would fire me as a patient on that phone call for daring to ask to speak to him and explain that the ADA is federal law and it supersedes the Texas State Law that no one can make a person wear a mask. Our disability needed to be accommodated so we could safely access the same services that those with no risk factors had. Our request of masking was reasonable because it was not cost prohibitive nor was it disruptive to the workings of the clinic. I explained to him that under the ADA he needed to give me a valid reason why he could not provide the masking accommodation or we would need to negotiate something else. He refused & fired me as a patient. I have Long Covid and we don’t know what is happening with my heart. As Dr. Sheriff was aware, his office is the only one masking at all. He knew we would have nowhere to go & he fully understands the severity of my condition. He didn’t care.  It took me calling 21 Dentists offices to find a dentist that would mask to clean & check my teeth. I told 21 people that I had a pericardiectomy and that I needed their help to safely access care. I was told 21 times that my health was not as important as their right to unmask. Twenty One dentists put their own interests above the best interest of the patient, regardless of their AMA Ethics Standards. Think of what that does to my mental health. This is happening around the United States every single day. Worse, many people are being exposed by their healthcare teams and sickened, hospitalized, disabled and even killed. Imagine how few people are even able to ask for these accommodations with the upside down power dynamic. Asking someone who holds your health in their hands to do you a favor that might enrage them….. Yeah, most people are not going to risk losing the favor of their healthcare provider or even losing them all together after waiting months to see them in the first place. That means people allow themselves to be exposed so they won’t “get in trouble”. This is called abuse. It is an abuse of power. If we are at high risk if exposed, we should be shielded from exposure. If we are to trust the opinion of our healthcare professionals, allowing them to harm us is counterproductive and will result in missed diagnosis, disability and deaths on a large scale.  We have reported all of this to all the appropriate government offices including the DOJ, HHS and State Medical Boards. None of these agencies have acted to protect us. HICPAC has a moral, legal and ethical duty to provide safe, equitable access for the Disabled and Medically Vulnerable. Implement changes to secure our human rights.

IRS,IRS-2023-0066,IRS-2023-0066-23389,"Thank you for issuing this strong guidance that recognizes the real impacts of producing hydrogen and clarifies which hydrogen projects will be eligible for the 45V tax credit established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The draft guidance avoids wasting billions of tax dollars on subsidies for dirty hydrogen production projects that would spike climate and health-harming pollution.    Hydrogen produced by fossil fuels is never a climate solution and tax credits should only go to hydrogen projects that are truly clean. Clean hydrogen production must meet three key requirements: Electrolysis must be powered by clean electricity that is 1) drawn from newly built carbon-free sources, 2) physically deliverable to the electrolysis facility, and 3) matched hourly with the electrolyzer’s power consumption.   The Biden administration must account for the full harms of producing hydrogen from methane, but its current modeling assumptions undercount climate pollution from the methane gas industry. The administration must also reject schemes that would reward polluters for creating more methane or allow the fossil fuel industry to greenwash its methane with biogas credits.    The Inflation Reduction Act represents the single biggest federal effort to combat the global climate crisis, but its success greatly depends on how this administration implements it.

BLM,BLM-2023-0006,BLM-2023-0006-76323,"Dear Bureau of Land Management,  I am opposed to oil and gas development in the Western Arctic.  Such development would be incompatible with meeting urgently needed commitments to address the climate crisis.  To demonstrate climate leadership and meet our commitments, the nation needs to move rapidly away from burning fossil fuels. There is no room for expansion, particularly in the Arctic, where oil would not come to market for years. The huge infrastructure build-out required would lock us into reliance on fossil fuels, while bringing further stress to a region feeling climate effects even more acutely than lower latitudes.  I urge the administration to take measures to bring its management of the Western Arctic in line with its commitment to address the climate crisis.     The proposed regulations are a step in the right direction but do not go far enough.  They offer important incremental protections for some of the Western Arctic’s most ecologically and culturally important areas, such as Teshekpuk Lake, an internationally vital wetland critical for birds from around the globe and for caribou herds that are integral to Alaska Native communities in the region.  However, they do not do enough to address the most imminent threat to the region and the planet—the over two million acres of existing oil leases in the Western Arctic that this administration inherited.  Development on these existing leases—like Willow—threatens the sensitive habitat of the Western Arctic and the nation’s ability to meet its climate goals.     The current environmental analysis of the Western Arctic, written in the previous administration, fails to study the impact oil development in the region would have on the climate and the nation’s ability to rapidly reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to meet climate goals.  We urge the administration to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the climate impacts of Western Arctic oil development, and to bring its management of the region in line with climate policy by expanding its proposed regulations to require limits on drilling on the millions of acres already leased to oil companies to protect the climate and the fragile resources of the region already under severe strain from climate change.

CMS,CMS-2023-0187,CMS-2023-0187-0709,"Dear CMS,  I am writing in support of the administrative support we receive from our upline/marketing organization.  Personally, our office services thousands of Medicare beneficiaries in the Northern Kentucky/Greater Cincinnati area.    I have been in the insurance industry for over 35 years in different capacities.  Servicing clients in the complicated healthcare industry has been a passion, has led to a great career and provided countless friends and peers.    Over 10 years ago, we saw a need for training and supporting agents in the Medicare industry.  We saw the upcoming numbers of Medicare beneficiaries along with medical technology extending life expectancies would lead to a vast shortage of good, local Medicare agents to serve the beneficiaries.  We were, and are, supported by a national marketing organization who provides us tools, technology, enrollment solutions, guidance, training and, most importantly, compliance support with the increased regulations.  We, in turn, have seen the deficiencies in the national organization's ability to truly support the local agent.  We have built training programs, provide individual support, designed proprietary software tools, offer continuing education and many other support levels.  We, as an organization, have been active in the education and support of the Medicare agent force, whether they are with our agency or not.  Two of us are on the board of directors for the NABIP-Kentucky chapter.  We developed, chair and manage the annual Medicare Summit for all Kentucky Medicare agents to attend.  We provide continuing education to the agent community and sponsor industry related events monthy and annually.  We believe in the local agents and have a passion for teaching them to run businesses supporting Medicare beneficiaries.  Some of the benefits our agents receive from our agency or our national partner are enrollment technologies, call recording technology, customer relationship management systems, quoting tools, plan finder software, errors and omissions insurance, field level training, compliance of marketing materials, approved template educational presentations and many others.    These benefits are too costly for our agency to support independent of our national partner.  These are much too expensive for our agents and, in my opinion, would create a disruption in quality service and, eventually, a loss of the much needed local field agent.  We ask that you not eliminate the administrative payments to the marketing organizations as they provide a great service to the industry and Medicare beneficiaries, directly and indirectly.  I thank you greatly for your time and consideration.

FS,FS-2023-0014,FS-2023-0014-0624,"I would like to express my disappointment in the United States Forest Service’s (USFS) proposal that would allow carbon injection in our national forests and grasslands.   1. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a false solution * CCS is ineffective at its core. Only 50-65% of CO2 is captured in a standard operation. * Captured carbon often ends up back in the hands of the fossil fuel industry to be used for enhanced oil recovery. * CCS prolongs the lifespan of the oil & industry and guarantees continued extraction, transport, and combustion of fossil fuels. * This is an investment in the wrong technology. We need to focus on a just transition to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels and supporting technologies, such as CCS.  2. Health impacts of CO2 pipelines and storage * Concentrated CO2 is an asphyxiant. When a pipeline leak happens, it can be deadly. * Not only are leaks possible, but pipeline ruptures of highly pressurized CO2  can cause mass casualty events that overwhelm hospital systems that are unprepared for such an event. (Case Study: Satartia, MS Denbury Pipeline Rupture; If interested, details can be found at Huffpost, https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gassing-satartia-mississippi-co2-pipeline_n_60ddea9fe4b0ddef8b0ddc8f) * “Storing” CO2 is likely to lead to leaks, which can lead to negative health outcomes. In addition, a leak makes earthquakes more likely near the storage area as well as the contamination of drinking water underground.  3. Climate change implications * CCS will cause unplanned carbon emissions, furthering climate change. * CO2 storage in national forests threatens them through leaks, ruptures, and potential earthquakes. We rely on these forests as carbon sinks – they are crucial for a zero-carbon future.  * By installing CCS, we are extending reliance on fossil fuels that are worsening climate change, leading to natural disasters, and contributing to poor public health and excess deaths.  USFS exists to “sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the Nation’s forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations.” This proposed exemption is diametrically opposed to the interests of the agency and our country as a whole.

The draft guidance avoids wasting billions of tax dollars on subsidies for dirty hydrogen production projects that would spike climate and health-harming pollution. Hydrogen produced by fossil fuels is never a climate solution and tax credits should only go to hydrogen projects that are truly clean. Clean hydrogen production must meet three key requirements: Electrolysis must be powered by clean electricity that is 1) drawn from newly built carbon-free sources, 2) physically deliverable to the electrolysis facility, and 3) matched hourly with the electrolyzer’s power consumption. The Biden administration must account for the full harms of producing hydrogen from methane, but its current modeling assumptions undercount climate pollution from the methane gas industry. The administration must also reject schemes that would reward polluters for creating more methane or allow the fossil fuel industry to greenwash its methane with biogas credits. The Inflation Reduction Act represents the single biggest federal effort to combat the global climate crisis, but its success greatly depends on how this administration implements it.

FDA,FDA-2019-N-5959,FDA-2019-N-5959-9131,"Dear Food & Drug Administration,  I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don't believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA's stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.  Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.  I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information. Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.  The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means. This goes against common sense and can put Americans' lives at risk. People deserve full access to their prescription drug information at all times, no matter their age, income, or geographic location.

EPA,EPA-HQ-OPP-2023-0457,EPA-HQ-OPP-2023-0457-0008,"Please see the following from the Ohio Association of Community Health Centers.           November 21, 2023    Aidan Black  Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention  Pesticide Re-evaluation Division (7508M)  Environmental Protection Agency  1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW  Washington, DC 20460–0001    Response to Request for Stakeholder Input on the Proposed Design of a New Grant  Program Regarding the Health Care Provider (HCP) Training Program (Docket EPA–HQ– OPP–2023–0457)    Dear Mr. Black:   Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments in response to the request for information  from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the design of a new grant program  regarding health care provider training and pesticides. This grant program would make an  important contribution regarding the recognition and management of pesticide poisonings among  populations overexposed to pesticides including underserved and health-disparate populations  such as farmworkers, farmworker children and families and rural communities.   The Ohio Association of Community Health Centers (OACHC) supports all of Ohio’s 59  Federally Qualified Health Centers and FQHC Look-Alikes (more commonly referred to as  Community Health Centers or CHCs), providing care to about one million Ohioans across 511+  sites throughout 76 of the 88 counties. Community Health Centers are non-profit health care  providers with patient-majority boards that meet the specific needs of the community they serve.  For nearly 60 years, CHCs have provided integrated whole person care, often providing medical,  dental, behavioral health, pharmacy, vision, and other needed supplemental services under one  roof. For additional information on OACHC’s mission and the Health Center Program, visit  www.ohiochc.org.    Outlined below are recommendations to consider as you develop this initiative:   1)  Characteristics of Lead Organization Responsible for EPA Health Care Provider  Initiative:      As EPA considers the design of a new training program, we strongly recommend that EPA  provides funding to an organization that is able to demonstrate the following:  •  The lead organization should be a national organization that has a wide geographic reach.   •  Extensive expertise in providing training and technical assistance to primary care  clinicians, including offering continuing medical and nursing education units.   In-depth knowledge of and expertise in farmworker health, occupational health and safety  and environmental justice.    •  •  A successful track record in leading EPA programs to train health care providers and a  demonstrated understanding of the barriers to recognizing and managing occupational  injuries and illnesses in the primary care setting.   •  Expertise in developing bilingual, culturally contextual educational materials to help  health care providers offer information and education to farmworkers and farmworker  family members about ways to protect themselves from pesticide exposure.     2)  Consideration of the Entire Health Care Provider Team  As EPA designs its new program, it is important to acknowledge the training needs of clinical  providers such physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and nurses as  well as nursing assistants, community health workers, outreach staff, social workers, patient  navigators, front desk staff, and triage staff, among others.  Community health centers and others  with a history of providing care to farmworkers and their families recognize that often an entire  team is need.   In primary care practice, clinical providers may have less time to spend with the  patient. This may impact the provider’s ability to spend extensive time educating the patient  about preventative measures.  Community health workers, outreach staff and others often have  more time as well as a skillset to communicate preventative strategies.  Additionally, community  health workers and outreach staff are important liaisons between the community and clinical care  and vice versa.  3)  Socio-Economic and Cultural Characteristics of Populations Exposed to Pesticides:    Farmworkers and their families are primarily Latino, Spanish speaking and immigrant.  Many  have low levels of literacy and limited formal education. Nearly half of all farmworkers do not  have authorization to work in the United States.  In addition to helping health care providers  recognize and manage pesticide exposures, a health care provider training program on this topic  must cover social determits of health to help clinicians understand the barriers that  farmworkers may face in seeking care after an exposure.  Culturally competent care demands  recognition that fear of job and income loss as well as deportation are eminent and real;  farmworkers have limited ability to access healthcare services, either because of lack of health  insurance, their priority to send ficial remittances to family in their homeland, or previous  discrimination.     Screening, History Taking and Electronic Medical Records  As EPA designs its program, it will be important to offer training and technical assistance to  health care providers regarding the incorporation of screening questions about where patients     live and the type of work their patients currently do and have previously done. For pediatric  patients this includes understanding the type of work the parent does.   It will be important that training and technical assistance underscore the importance of  incorporating key components of the recognition and management of pesticide exposure into the  electronic medical record system. This will include incorporating screening questions, reporting  requirements and forms for data collection on an acute pesticide-exposed patient.     4)  Other Groups to Consider  In addition to farmworkers and their families, there are other groups to consider regarding  pesticide exposures.  Other important occupational groups to consider in the recognition and  management of pesticide exposures are landscapers and custodial workers.  Children are  particularly vulnerable to pesticide exposure and should be considered as well.   5)  Engage with National Training and Technical Assistance Partners (NTTAPs)The  lead organization should be encouraged to engage with certain National Training and  Technical Assistance Partners (NTTAPs)—funded by the Health Resources and Services  Administration (HRSA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to  provide training and technical assistance to health centers—that have experience serving  farmworker populations and conducting clinician training on issues of occupational and  environmental health. These organizations can help disseminate information, materials  and tools to clinicians and health centers they serve, build capacity among health centers,  and identify opportunities to build upon previous activities to strengthen health care  providers’ ability to serve farmworker patients.  Summary  Health care providers are often unequipped to address environmental and occupational injuries  and illnesses. I am pleased to see EPA design a program to support the provision of training and  technical assistance to health care providers. We highly recommend that EPA emphasize  supporting national organizations like Migrant Clinicians Network with extensive expertise in  providing training and technical assistance to health care providers and expertise in  environmental and occupational health.   If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please feel free to contact me at (614)  507-7805 or jdirossi@ohiochc.org.

IRS,IRS-2023-0066,IRS-2023-0066-19417,"Thank you for your leadership in implementing the Inflation Reduction Act and for the opportunity to comment on the Treasury Department&#039;s draft 45V rule determining who qualifies for the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit.I believe the Department took a big step in the right direction by including the &quot;three pillars&quot; in the draft rule to ensure that hydrogen produced from clean electricity (&quot;green hydrogen&quot;) will truly be clean. The three-pillar framework will prevent substantial emissions increases from hydrogen production, avoid electricity price spikes for homes and businesses, and support the longer-term viability of the hydrogen industry.I encourage the Department to strengthen the draft rule by ensuring we are maximizing the climate benefits of hydrogen and not paying producers to pollute. I am deeply concerned about the draft rule&#039;s proposal to allow heavily polluting projects to qualify as &quot;clean&quot; by purchasing renewable natural gas (&quot;RNG&quot;) offsets rather than changing their technologies or processes. This would fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and harm the health of nearby communities. I am also concerned about the draft rule underestimating certain greenhouse gas emissions from hydrogen &ndash; this mistake could encourage hydrogen that is worse for the climate than the fossil fuels it&#039;s replacing. The final rule must ensure that upstream methane emissions are fully counted and discouraged.

FDA,FDA-2019-N-5959,FDA-2019-N-5959-10989,"Dear Food & Drug Administration,  I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don't believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA's stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.  Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.  I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information. Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.  The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means. This goes against common sense and can put Americans' lives at risk. People deserve full access to their prescription drug information at all times, no matter their age, income, or geographic location.  I urge you to revise your proposed rule for patient medication information in two ways:  1. Require a standardized printed format that has been scientifically researched and proven to improve patient understanding.  2. Require the drug manufacturer to supply the printed information and have it accompany the drug product and not printed in a retail pharmacy.  Doing so will help save lives and improve medication outcomes.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

IRS,IRS-2023-0066,IRS-2023-0066-9675,"Thank you for issuing this strong guidance that recognizes the real impacts of producing hydrogen and clarifies which hydrogen projects will be eligible for the 45V tax credit established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The draft guidance avoids wasting billions of tax dollars on subsidies for dirty hydrogen production projects that would spike climate and health-harming pollution. Hydrogen produced by fossil fuels is never a climate solution and tax credits should only go to hydrogen projects that are truly clean. Clean hydrogen production must meet three key requirements: Electrolysis must be powered by clean electricity that is 1) drawn from newly built carbon-free sources, 2) physically deliverable to the electrolysis facility, and 3) matched hourly with the electrolyzer’s power consumption. The Biden administration must account for the full harms of producing hydrogen from methane, but its current modeling assumptions undercount climate pollution from the methane gas industry. The administration must also reject schemes that would reward polluters for creating more methane or allow the fossil fuel industry to greenwash its methane with biogas credits. The Inflation Reduction Act represents the single biggest federal effort to combat the global climate crisis, but its success greatly depends on how this administration implements it. We urge your agency to finalize strong guidance that will drive taxpayer dollars towards projects that do not exacerbate climate pollution from power plants or spur more fossil gas drilling.Sincerely,Lisa KobosMorgantown, WV",The commenter expresses their support for the guidance that recognizes the real impacts of producing hydrogen and clarifies which hydrogen projects will be eligible for the 45V tax credit established by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Washington, D.C. 20210   RE: RIN 1210-AC02   Dear Honorable Gomez,  I am writing this letter to express my fears over the new U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) proposed fiduciary rule that will threaten my ability as a ficial professional to serve the many lower and middle-income Main Street families who are currently able to access from me and my colleagues sound, unconflicted ficial advice to advance their ficial and retirement security.    This new rule proposes to revise the current fiduciary rule under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), governing the advice that ficial advisors provide their clients. This proposed revision largely resurrects the failed 2016 DOL “fiduciary-only” rule that limited savers’ choice of advisors and investments by imposing excessive amounts of costly red tape and duplicative administrative requirements on the investment transactions they make for their retirement.   With this proposed revision, DOL ignores the real-world experience decisively demonstrating that the 2016 DOL fiduciary rule significantly harmed lower and middle-income workers before being thrown out in 2018 by a federal appeals court. The adoption of the 2016 fiduciary rule resulted in more than 10 million smaller retirement account owners losing the ability to work with their preferred ficial professionals.  Main Street savers could simply not afford to retain advisors under the fiduciary-only model of regulation. Moreover, if DOL adopts a new rule that is like the 2016 rule, recent research concludes the retirement savings of 2.7 million individuals with incomes below $100,000 would plummet by $140 billion over ten years. Black and Latino retirement account owners would be among the hardest hit, increasing the racial wealth gap by 20 percent.   Since the 2016 fiduciary rule was invalidated, regulators at the federal and state levels have adopted significant new regulations that directly address the conflicts of interest that DOL asserts it is seeking to address with its new proposed rule. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI), which requires all broker-dealers and their registered representatives to always act in their client’s best interest without putting their own interests first. In addition, more than forty states have now enacted an updated National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) model regulation that requires insurance producers to satisfy a best interest standard that aligns well with Reg BI. In addition, DOL adopted its own new rule in 2020 that complements the federal and state regulatory regime.   Adoption of this proposed rule is both dangerous and unnecessary.  It is dangerous because it will leave millions of Main Street investors on their own in trying to achieve retirement security for themselves and their families. It is unnecessary because there are already federal and state regulatory structures to protect consumers, and DOL has provided no evidence that consumers are not being protected by the existing rules.   I ask that you please withdraw the proposed final regulation and proposed amendments to protect the interest of Main Street Americans.   Sincerely,  Lodie Biggs Tennessee ","The commenter expresses their fears over the new U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) proposed fiduciary rule that will threaten their ability as a ficial professional to serve the many lower and middle-income Main Street families who are currently able to access from them and their colleagues sound, unconflicted ficial advice to advance their ficial and retirement security.",True positive,The commenter expresses fears that the proposed DOL fiduciary rule will limit access to financial advice for lower and middle-income families.

FDA,FDA-2019-N-5959,FDA-2019-N-5959-33868,"Dear Food & Drug Administration,  I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don't believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA's stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.  Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.  I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information. Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.  The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means. This goes against common sense and can put Americans' lives at risk. People deserve full access to their prescription drug information at all times, no matter their age, income, or geographic location.  I urge you to revise your proposed rule for patient medication information in two ways:  1. Require a standardized printed format that has been scientifically researched and proven to improve patient understanding.  2. Require the drug manufacturer to supply the printed information and have it accompany the drug product and not printed in a retail pharmacy.  Doing so will help save lives and improve medication outcomes.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

IRS,IRS-2023-0066,IRS-2023-0066-15810,"Thank you for issuing this strong guidance that recognizes the real impacts of producing hydrogen and clarifies which hydrogen projects will be eligible for the 45V tax credit established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The draft guidance avoids wasting billions of tax dollars on subsidies for dirty hydrogen production projects that would spike climate and health-harming pollution.    Hydrogen produced by fossil fuels is never a climate solution and tax credits should only go to hydrogen projects that are truly clean.

CMS,CMS-2023-0144,CMS-2023-0144-44069,"See attached comment letter      	   November 6, 2023              Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, Administrator  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  Department of Health and Human Services  Attention:  CMS-4201-P  P.O. Box 8013  Baltimore, MD  21244      Re: Medicare and Medicaid Program: Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care  Facilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting    Submitted electronically via www.regulations.gov    Dear Administrator Brooks-LaSure,     On behalf of the Coalition to Transform Advanced Care (C-TAC), we appreciate the  opportunity to provide comments on this proposed rule regarding its effect on those living  with serious illness.    C-TAC is a national non-partisan, not-for-profit coalition dedicated to ensuring that all  those living with serious illness, especially the sickest and most vulnerable, receive  comprehensive, high-quality, person- and family-centered care that is consistent with their  goals and values and honors their dignity. C-TAC comprises more than 200 national and  regional organizations including patient and consumer advocacy groups, practitioners,  health plans, faith-based and community organizations, and others who share a common  vision of improving care for serious illness in the U.S.    C-TAC defines serious illness as a health condition that carries a high risk of mortality and either  negatively impacts a person’s daily function or quality of life, or excessively strains their family  caregivers. This definition has been widely adopted, including by the National Committee for  Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the National Quality Forum (NQF).     Serious illness is also a health equity issue. A history of disenfranchisement has led to  healthcare gaps across the country. Per a 2021 Commonwealth report on racial and ethnic  health equity, communities of color live fewer years, on average, than white people do, are more  likely to die from treatable conditions, and are also at higher risk for many chronic health  conditions.  For serious illness, the lack of access to health insurance and primary care mean  many are diagnosed only at a late or end stage of illness, when disease-modifying treatment is  	    	 typically no longer effective. Those from historically under-resourced communities who also  have serious illness experience poorer care and access, making improving their care a health  equity opportunity.    With this perspective, we make the following comments on this proposed rule:    Quality of care  We agree with CMS that providing the highest quality care possible to those living in long-term  care (LTC) facilities is a priority. As the proposed rule notes, this is a very vulnerable population  that is often dependent on others to provide care for them. Some also lack outside support  systems or family to advocate for them so facilities need to ensure that the care they provide is  of the highest quality. We therefore support the concept of staffing standards as a way to  ensure adequate staffing ratios to provide good care but have concerns about the specifics in  this proposal. Specifically, while we understand the exclusion of LPNs from the proposed  staffing ratios, we urge CMS to find a way to include this important role with whatever  evidence supports it. We also feel that staffing requirements ideally need to include providers  like physicians or advanced practitioners, since they are also currently under-represented and  play a vital role in providing quality care in this setting. We also encourage CMS to consider  creative use of technology, such as virtual nurses or providers, who could supplement in-person  staff and provide further support and expertise.     Staffing realities  However, we also recognized the chronic staffing shortages in such facilities, which have only  worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic. While some facilities may always have tried to get by  with inadequate staffing, we know that many are having trouble finding adequate staffing,  given the many other options these resources have. Therefore, while we agree with the list of  potential consequences on page 44 for facilities not meeting these requirements, we  recommend that any penalties be introduced so as to give facilities adequate time to bring  staffing up to any required levels. We also encourage CMS to work with HRSA and other  agencies to develop innovative ways to grow the potential staffing pool for LTC employees as  what is needed is more people who want to do this important work rather than facilities  fighting for the limited few already available.     Care for those with serious illness  We also suggest that practitioner and nursing staff be adequately trained to care for those in  their facilities with serious illness. This, of course, means most of their patients, since anyone  requiring long-term care has either a serious illness, debility, and/or frailty. In addition, we  continue to advocate that services like palliative care be made available to LTC residents and  that such care be ideally delivered by a trained interdisciplinary team.     End-of-life care  Finally, for those LTC residents at the end of life, we note that higher nursing and provider staff  to patient ratios are a must and that engaging additional services, like hospice, should also be  2  	    	 promoted. My own mother died in an LTC facility with inadequate staffing and untrained staff.  This was both tragic and unnecessary and must be avoided for others in such facilities.       Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule.  If you have any questions,  please contact Marian Grant, Senior Regulatory Advisor, C-TAC, at mgrant@thectac.org.

FDA,FDA-2019-N-5959,FDA-2019-N-5959-8883,"Dear Food & Drug Administration,  I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don't believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA's stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.  Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.  I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information. Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.  The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means. This goes against common sense and can put Americans' lives at risk. People deserve full access to their prescription drug information at all times, no matter their age, income, or geographic location.  I urge you to revise your proposed rule for patient medication information in two ways:  1. Require a standardized printed format that has been scientifically researched and proven to improve patient understanding.  2. Require the drug manufacturer to supply the printed information and have it accompany the drug product and not printed in a retail pharmacy.  Doing so will help save lives and improve medication outcomes.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

As Indiana Wildlife Services states in the Environmental Assessment, educational outreach efforts already include promoting coexistence between humans and wild animals and human behavior modification. This should be emphasized and prioritized in the plan that Wildlife Services chooses to move forward with. The agency could also help to fund and develop new infrastructure to protect against bird damage.   In conclusion, the agency should either proceed with Alternative 2 or create an alternative that requires all non-lethal methods to be used to their fullest extent before lethal action is taken. Wildlife Services should also commit to exploring long-term, non-lethal solutions that promote harmony between humans and wild animals.

FDA,FDA-2019-N-5959,FDA-2019-N-5959-39108,"Dear Food & Drug Administration,  I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don't believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA's stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.  Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.  I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information. Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.  The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means.

AMS,AMS-NOP-23-0052,AMS-NOP-23-0052-0827,"The Earth needs many more real organic farms to support soil health, help sequester carbon dioxide, and avoid the use of materials that contribute many times as much warming potential as carbon dioxide. USDA’s failure to require information to ensure consistent application of the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) threatens the integrity of organic products upon which I depend.   At 6513(b)(1), OFPA states, “An organic plan shall contain provisions designed to foster soil fertility, primarily through the management of the organic content of the soil through proper tillage, crop rotation, and manuring.” OFPA 6513(g) states, “An organic plan shall not include any production or handling practices that are inconsistent with this chapter.”   NOP now accredits certifying agents that certify soil-based crop producers who comply with the soil fertility requirements of OFPA 6513(b)(1) and 7 CFR sections 205.2, Natural Resource Protection; 205.203 Soil Fertility and Nutrient Management; and 205.205 Crop Rotation. NOP also accredits certifying agents that certify hydroponic, container, and other soilless crop producers who do not comply with those same requirements.   Soil-based organic production systems sequester carbon, fix nitrogen, build soil health, increase the water-holding capacity of soils, prevent soil erosion, foster the cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, conserve biodiversity, and provide numerous ecological services, while hydroponic, aquaponic, and other soilless container growing systems do not, yet USDA allows such operations to be certified “organic.”    Despite significant differences between soil-based and soilless crop production systems, USDA has no data to determine or research how much of the U.S. organic market is comprised of the products from these two different production systems, since the products of both systems are labeled “organic” and allowed to carry the “USDA Organic” logo and compare the environmental and health impacts of these systems.   NOP must collect data on the type of production system used by certified organic crop producers to determine the number of soil-based vs soilless crop production operations and products, both foreign and domestic, that are being certified as “organic” under NOP. Accredited certifying agents must ask specific questions to assess all crop operations’ compliance with OFPA 6513(b)(1), since the law states that organic crop plans “shall contain provisions designed to foster soil fertility.”   In order to “assure consumers that organically produced products meet a consistent standard,” NOP must require that accredited certifying agents who certify hydroponic, aquaponic, and other soilless container systems provide data to NOP—and make it publicly available—on the number of such operations that they certify; the amount of acreage or square footage in soilless production; the types and quantities of crops produced using soilless production methods; the expected vs actual yields from soilless operations; the value of the crops produced using soilless production methods; the labels and brand names used on all such products; the countries of origin; and the markets where these products are sold.    The U.S. is the only country where soilless crop production systems are being certified as “organic,” so collection of the information cited above is needed to verify compliance with trade agreements in international organic markets.     USDA has issued no rules governing the soilless production of “organic” crops, so it is incumbent on USDA to collect accurate and detailed information on both soil-based and soilless crop production systems that are being certified as “organic,” in order to comply with OFPA Sections 6501(2), 6513(b), and 6513(g), and 7 CFR Part 205.2, 205.203, and 205.205.

Require the drug manufacturer to supply the printed information and have it accompany the drug product and not printed in a retail pharmacy.  Doing so will help save lives and improve medication outcomes.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

IRS,IRS-2023-0066,IRS-2023-0066-12033,"Thank you for issuing this strong guidance that recognizes the real impacts of producing hydrogen and clarifies which hydrogen projects will be eligible for the 45V tax credit established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The draft guidance avoids wasting billions of tax dollars on subsidies for dirty hydrogen production projects that would spike climate and health-harming pollution.    Hydrogen produced by fossil fuels is never a climate solution and tax credits should only go to hydrogen projects that are truly clean. Clean hydrogen production must meet three key requirements: Electrolysis must be powered by clean electricity that is 1) drawn from newly built carbon-free sources, 2) physically deliverable to the electrolysis facility, and 3) matched hourly with the electrolyzer’s power consumption.   The Biden administration must account for the full harms of producing hydrogen from methane, but its current modeling assumptions undercount climate pollution from the methane gas industry. The administration must also reject schemes that would reward polluters for creating more methane or allow the fossil fuel industry to greenwash its methane with biogas credits.    The Inflation Reduction Act represents the single biggest federal effort to combat the global climate crisis, but its success greatly depends on how this administration implements it. We urge your agency to finalize strong guidance that will drive taxpayer dollars towards projects that do not exacerbate climate pollution from power plants or spur more fossil gas drilling.

EBSA,EBSA-2023-0014,EBSA-2023-0014-3764,"Rosemary Nyamoki 307 Center Street, Bridgewater, MA, USA  The Honorable Lisa M. Gomez Assistant Secretary of Labor Employee Benefits Security Administration  U. S. Department of Labor 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.  Washington, D.C. 20210  Re: RIN 1210-AC02  Assistant Secretary Gomez:  I am writing to express serious concerns with the Department of Labor's (the ""Department"") proposed Retirement Security Rule: Definition of an Investment Advice Fiduciary and Associated Prohibited Transaction Exemption Amendments (collectively, the ""Proposal""). For the reasons summarized here and explained in more detail in our comments below, I strongly urge the Department to withdraw this fundamentally flawed Proposal.  As a ficial security professional, I am dedicated to assisting American families, individuals, and small businesses within my community and help them fulfill the dream of ficial security, which includes a secure and dignified retirement. I provide advice to create holistic ficial plans that serve my clients’ best interests for a secure ficial future. Independent research by Ernst and Young proves that the combination of life insurance, investments, and annuities deliver objectively better outcomes for consumers. As a member of Finseca, I believe deeply in the mission of ficial security for all.   The Proposal, however, will have a detrimental effect on the ficial security profession, limiting the ability to provide holistic retirement planning and the essential ficial security that clients are seeking. It significantly broadens the definition of investment fiduciary advice while restricting the available exemptions relied upon by ficial security advisors. The Proposal overlooks the consequences both for the ficial security profession and the Americans who depend on us.  The Proposal Limits Access to Advice Imposing a fiduciary-only, fee-only model for advice would exclude retirement savers, especially those with low- and middle-income, who lack the required account minimum, denying them essential retirement advice. The proposal will lead to increased costs for ficial advice, coupled with a reduction in product choices and a decrease in the number of available advisors. These risks are not theoretical—the Department’s 2016 fiduciary regulation (“2016 Rule”) caused reduced access to ficial assistance for as many as 10 million accounts holding $900 billion in assets.  The Proposal Suggests My Work is “Junk” The service I provide to my clients and their families is valued as indispensable for their families and businesses. Consumer choice of transparent fees for accessing that advice is NOT a “junk fee.”  One size does not fit all: commission models better serve some retirement savers, while fee-based cost models better serve others. Consumer should have access to both models to choose what best serves their individual needs.    The Proposal Seeks to Ignores New Protections in Place Developed by Federal and State Regulators The playing field has changed since the DOL’s last attempt in 2016. The SEC, FINRA and nearly all state insurance regulators have adopted new guidance and regulations that improve consumer protections, including adopting best interest standards, and enhanced disclosures. The SEC's Regulation Best Interest has been in effect since 2019, and the NAIC Model Act for Annuities has been adopted by 40 states. What evidence do you have of a widespread problem, inefficiency, or gap in the current regulatory structure?   The Proposal Makes it Harder to become a Ficial Security Professional The regulatory burden is already a substantial weight on my practice, my clients, and my ability to serve more people. I shudder to think of the impact the Proposal will have on someone new to the profession and just starting out. I also believe your rule will limit opportunities for mentorship and apprenticeship of new advisors by more senior ones.   The ficial security profession currently maintains stringent qualification and licensing requirements. However, the Proposal’s additional and excessively burdensome procedures, aimed at addressing a few “bad actors,” will significantly impede existing professionals to continue their careers and discourage new entrants, which is troubling as we currently need more ficial advisors, not fewer. In fact, the profession has been flat – despite the $12 trillion dollar gap between what people have and what they should in protection.  I urge you and the Department to withdraw the proposed final regulation and proposed amendments to protect the interests of America's workers, families, and retirees.   Thank you for your consideration.

FDA,FDA-2016-D-2343,FDA-2016-D-2343-0218,"I am writing to express concern at the FDA’s approach to allowing food companies to ignore small amounts of allergen contamination when designing food safety programs to address allergen risks. The FDA’s recent guidance entitled “Chapter 11: Food Allergy Program of the Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food: Draft Guidance for Industry,” suggests that companies can use such “thresholds” in designing preventive controls to protect against allergen cross-contamination. However, the FDA leaves it up to food companies to decide what these thresholds might be and how to ensure that consumers are not put at too much risk by the contamination.   Approximately one in 10 U.S. customers are affected by food allergies, and more should be done to allow them to protect themselves when they make food purchasing decisions. To do this, consumers need clear information about cross-contamination risks, such as reliable and consistent “may contains” statements on food labels. The FDA should also prevent companies from adding allergens to their foods as a response to allergen contamination risks. (Some companies do this because it’s easier to add allergens to everything rather than ensure that cross-contamination does not occur between products).    I urge the FDA to retract its discussion of thresholds in this guidance. Instead, the FDA should create a comprehensive approach to cross-contact risks, that includes providing guidance that clearly defines accepted precautionary allergen labeling and bans the intentional addition of allergens to skirt food safety requirements.      Thank you.

APHIS,APHIS-2015-0093,APHIS-2015-0093-10368,"As someone who cares deeply about deer and human-wildlife conflict mitigation, I urge you to revisit your environmental impact assessment and more thoroughly consider an alternative that would utilize non-lethal management strategies exclusively. Without this consideration, your Environmental Assessment does not assess the full breadth of options to address deer-human conflicts. I also urge you to then implement these non-lethal strategies and pursue them first before lethal action is taken.  While I understand the challenges posed by urban deer populations, I strongly believe that a more compassionate and effective approach is needed and can be equally as effective as killing deer.   Exclusion methods, such as fencing, can address conflicts in airports and agricultural spaces, while landscape modifications and planting deer-repelling vegetation can mitigate conflicts in community green spaces and on private property. Frightening devices, animal behavior modification, and live capture and translocation offer humane alternatives as well.  Immunocontraceptives like GonaCon have also been proven effective at controlling deer populations, and an alternative that prioritizes immunocontraceptives as a solution should be given serious consideration within your Environmental Assessment.   I urge Wildlife Services to reconsider the current plan and go back to the drawing board, giving due consideration to an alternative that exclusively focuses on non-lethal damage mitigation.

FDA,FDA-2019-N-5959,FDA-2019-N-5959-51844,"Dear Food & Drug Administration,  I am writing because I am concerned about your proposed rule regarding printed prescription drug information for patients. I appreciate that the FDA recognizes the importance of printed drug information for patients, but I believe the proposed rule lacks important patient protections. I don't believe the drafted rule achieves the FDA's stated goal of improving health because it does not require clear and useful printed prescription drug product information provided in the right manner.  Like most Americans, my family and I take prescription medication, and we struggle to understand the printed medication information that accompanies our medications. We need to improve our understanding of the drugs we are taking and need improved printed copy to help us.  I need clear, always accessible and useful written prescription drug product information. Patients need a standardized layout researched to improve patient understanding and retention of information. Standardization principles should include use of color, consistent headings and MINIMUM FONT SIZES to increase understanding. Patient understanding and retention of information should be rigorously tested with REAL patient populations taking REAL prescription medication before adoption. Why would the FDA consider a change in prescription information for patients without first researching a format that improves patient understanding? I also believe the FDA should require standards for high quality printing and inspection so that ALL required information is present.  The FDA rule, as it currently stands, could force the elderly and other patients to access life-saving information by only electronic means. This goes against common sense and can put Americans' lives at risk. People deserve full access to their prescription drug information at all times, no matter their age, income, or geographic location.  I urge you to revise your proposed rule for patient medication information in two ways:  1. Require a standardized printed format that has been scientifically researched and proven to improve patient understanding.  2. Require the drug manufacturer to supply the printed information and have it accompany the drug product and not printed in a retail pharmacy.

IRS,IRS-2023-0066,IRS-2023-0066-21379,"Thank you for your leadership in implementing the Inflation Reduction Act and for the opportunity to comment on the Treasury Department&#039;s draft 45V rule determining who qualifies for the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit.I believe the Department took a big step in the right direction by including the &quot;three pillars&quot; in the draft rule to ensure that hydrogen produced from clean electricity (&quot;green hydrogen&quot;) will truly be clean. The three-pillar framework will prevent substantial emissions increases from hydrogen production, avoid electricity price spikes for homes and businesses, and support the longer-term viability of the hydrogen industry.I encourage the Department to strengthen the draft rule by ensuring we are maximizing the climate benefits of hydrogen and not paying producers to pollute. I am deeply concerned about the draft rule&#039;s proposal to allow heavily polluting projects to qualify as &quot;clean&quot; by purchasing renewable natural gas (&quot;RNG&quot;) offsets rather than changing their technologies or processes.

BLM,BLM-2023-0006,BLM-2023-0006-75719,"Dear Bureau of Land Management,  I am opposed to oil and gas development in the Western Arctic.  Such development would be incompatible with meeting urgently needed commitments to address the climate crisis.  To demonstrate climate leadership and meet our commitments, the nation needs to move rapidly away from burning fossil fuels. There is no room for expansion, particularly in the Arctic, where oil would not come to market for years. The huge infrastructure build-out required would lock us into reliance on fossil fuels, while bringing further stress to a region feeling climate effects even more acutely than lower latitudes.  I urge the administration to take measures to bring its management of the Western Arctic in line with its commitment to address the climate crisis.     The proposed regulations are a step in the right direction but do not go far enough.  They offer important incremental protections for some of the Western Arctic’s most ecologically and culturally important areas, such as Teshekpuk Lake, an internationally vital wetland critical for birds from around the globe and for caribou herds that are integral to Alaska Native communities in the region.  However, they do not do enough to address the most imminent threat to the region and the planet—the over two million acres of existing oil leases in the Western Arctic that this administration inherited.  Development on these existing leases—like Willow—threatens the sensitive habitat of the Western Arctic and the nation’s ability to meet its climate goals.     The current environmental analysis of the Western Arctic, written in the previous administration, fails to study the impact oil development in the region would have on the climate and the nation’s ability to rapidly reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to meet climate goals.

I support the USFWS taking a step in the right direction through the proposed regulation aiming to limit predator control across the National Wildlife Refuge System, as outlined in docket number FWS–HQ–NWRS–2022–0106. Nevertheless, the regulation should explicitly forbid trapping and the killing of predators for recreation and ""damage control"". All of these practices, excluded from the current rule, are deemed inhumane and contradict the fundamental purpose of establishing these lands as sanctuaries for wildlife.  The National Wildlife Refuge System is the only home many wolves, bears, mountain lions, bobcats, and foxes have ever known. The prohibition of predator-control programs and indiscriminate body-gripping traps on refuges is essential for making their home safer, increasing their wellbeing, and allowing them to flourish. As a result, carnivores will be able to fulfill their ecological roles, which promote ecosystem resilience, biodiversity and human well-being.
